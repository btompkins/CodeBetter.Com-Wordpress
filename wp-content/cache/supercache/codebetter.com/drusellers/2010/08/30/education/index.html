(This question led me to following thoughts, I suck at grammar and am not saying this is how we actually learn, these are just the thoughts that came to me while pondering that question.) That we are first taught the most fundamental of basics in a language, the ABCs, the sounds of our native tongue. Through this most primitive of understanding we start to grow our proficiency.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t attend university courses on software development but I would guess that it doesn&#8217;t start with learning about AND/OR/NOT constructs. Not that we need to spend a crap ton of time on this topic but do we spend any? Is there any value in it, when I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Stone-Computers-Science-Masters/dp/046502596X">Pattern on the Stone</a> I found understanding the basics to be fascinating. It&#8217;s understanding things at that low level that I feel has allowed me understand things at the higher levels.</p>
<p>As we progress in our understanding, we should move away from using primitive language structures, and start to develop a level of comprehension that goes beyond simple sentences, and one word responses. We need to learn how to compose prepositional sentences, and transitions. When I read O<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-DV-Microsoft-Professional-David/dp/0735619654/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1283121078&amp;sr=1-2">bject Thinking</a> I started to see the world as the designers of object oriented languages wanted me too. Now I just need to find the books on functional and other language styles.</p>
<p>Learning how to compose the chapters and novels of our software development can prove to be an even larger challenge for us in the software development community. It takes an awful long time to build up a program that has enough complexity to warrant being compared to a 300 or 400 page book. We study the architecture of our language from the time we are infants, how can we embed the concept of architecture in programming through out the whole of the education? When our projects are relatively small by comparison the large programs we will become responsible for when we move out to the real world?</p>
<p>Though I have studied many other languages than English (German, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese) I am not sure its helped me really understand English. But my friends who actually are proficient in there non-native languages say that it helps. Are we asked to study multiple languages? This is an area I am sure is better addressed, but are we studying the differences in the languages. The values enshrined in .Net over Perl over Python over Ruby over Assembly etc? To see why some languages suck at some tasks and other languages are great for other tasks. Are we taught how to build a simple language, and then a simple language on top of another language, and then a DSL. To see the various amounts of effort required to achieve the simplest of things?</p>
<p>Where are the art and craft classes of software development, where the value is on the aesthetic of the program and on the code. Where is the poetry class of software design where we focus on writing that one-liner of pearl? Where is the class that teaches us the code smells and how to fix them.</p>
<p>What about the journalism class where we learn to communicate to the masses. Where we learn to speak to an audience larger than one passionate reader. To publish on a deadline, to not write above our readership. To realize that even though we may have an extended vocabulary and that is some thing that we should pride our selves on, that we must remember that people other than us are going to be reading it and that the goal is comprehension not on flexing our vocabulary might.</p>
<p>Ok, well I think I have pushed this metaphor about as far as I want to. Thank you for reading, I hope that it inspires you to think about what you will learn next.</p>

In fact, it mostly focused on theory behind these constructs (gate based logic, nand gates etc&#8230;) and then progressed more and more into higher theoretical applications (looping, recursion, assembly, compilers, etc&#8230;). </p>
<p>My argument is that the basics aren&#8217;t the problem, its the application of the basics that is being left out of the curriculum.  How do I build a maintainable system?  How do I put all these different parts together?</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-198" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, I certainly am a friend of learning the basics first. I&#8217;m coming from electrotechnical engineering to enterprise software development, so I started with the very basics (like in diode transistor logic) and I will always have a crush for the low level stuff.</p>
<p>Although I have to say that I don&#8217;t think that the focus of the study should be on how good you perform in the industry later. studying is more to learn about scientific methods, measurement and judgement. If you get some courses about maintainability, that&#8217;s fine, but hopefully it&#8217;s not your focus to turn yourself into the best working droid out there&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you think it will be necessary in the future of programming that every developer needs a good understanding of the hardware (or low level logic) to successfully build software? Or will the languages and framework hide most of that from the people?</p>

We also had a software development course where we had to build a a software system for a customer and included things like customer interaction, etc. Another course covered TDD and other aspects of writing maintainable code. The problem is that when you are in university you don&#8217;t understand the importance of these things until you have a few years of development in the real world under your belt.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-201" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Actually, we start learning language from our birth-day &#8211; at least conversational. It is an advanced language instruction also, because it is generally coming from adults who have been speaking for some time. We are thrown in the deep end with complex conditionals and prepositional phrases. The formal language instruction starts with the basics, but that&#8217;s only so that we can map the nontrivial concepts called reading and writing to the innate speaking ability.</p>
<p>Similar programming language instruction would involve throwing newbie programmers into high-level design at the beginning under the careful supervision of others who have been doing the same thing for some time. As that instruction progresses, the basics would get picked up. That just happens to describe the craftsmanship/apprenticeship movement that&#8217;s pretty popular right now.</p>
