Beyond the obvious that is (I don&#8217;t care about start up time, or any other performance hogwash). It seems that early in my career I thought 10 assembly references was absurd, now that number is MUCH higher (almost without limit) but this view is intensely not the view held by the larger .net community. I take a look at other communities outside of .net and see people doing a much better job of pulling together a multitude of libraries to construct even simple sites versus the vast majority of .net projects I have seen that seem to go out of their way to avoid a dependency hit. Not to mention the enterprise projects that build massive systems and taking no more dependencies than exist in the BCL.</p>
<p>This bias of not wanting to import a larger number of references has impacted the way I design my .net code, and I am not sure I would do the same if I were in another language. For instance, I have a library called Magnum that is a junk drawer of functionality for my other projects. Every now and then someone will see the reference in another project and will go take a look at it. To there surprise, it contains a vast and deep amount of code that could be very useful to them. But to import it means to import a LOT of stuff. Why don&#8217;t I break up this codebase? Because of my negative view on assembly references. &#8220;Le sigh.&#8221; Should I just start splitting things up more? How does this splintering of Magnum effect other things?</p>
<p>A part of me wonders if this isn&#8217;t caused by the same effects of &#8216;The Tale of J. Random Newbie&#8217; in the Art of Unix Programming pg 415. Go read the 4 pages or so. I will wait.</p>
<p><a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/graphics/taoup.pdf">The Art of Unix Programming</a></p>
<p>It would not surprise me if the lack of OSS experience and transparency in the large part of the .Net community isn&#8217;t responsible for this.</p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t, in practice, ignore the impacts of additional assembly references on the performance of my applications. Has anyone actually measured this?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

It is _very_ unlikely that you&#8217;ll be able to get a meaningful difference on modern hardware in any non contrived test.</p>
<p>Reasons to want to do that:<br />
* Reducing download size<br />
* Reducing dependency management complexities<br />
** If I am using 5 libraries, I might need to update one of them every other month. If I am using 25, I might be needing to update one of them every week.<br />
* Reducing the chance of conflicts.<br />
** NHibernate &amp; Castle were a great example of a problematic dependency cycle, until we broke that.</p>

Yes, in Orchard we have. It is not negligible, which is a bummer in a highly modular system. Then again, it is not negligible *because* we are highly modular, and people tend to add lots of stuff. I agree with Ayende that in ordinary apps it does not matter and is just silly. I think it&#8217;s not just the OSS culture that is lacking though, it&#8217;s also that other environments are mostly dynamic languages where the impact is lower, or at least of a different nature. I think.</p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-376" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Personally, I feel that the number of assembly references has a massive impact on application loading times &#8211; especially in Web applications. But this is &#8216;only&#8217; gut feeling, I also haven&#8217;t seen concrete, measures on this yet.</p>
<p>But the most important point to me for minimizing assembly references to the bare minimum is just architectural cleanliness! Mainly for two reasons:<br />
1.<br />
In large projects, you have a lot of third-party references anyway. This in turn leads to cross-dependencies. It&#8217;s true that we don&#8217;t have the &#8216;dll hell&#8217; anymore, but we still have some kind of &#8216;assemblyversion limbo&#8217;: We need to make sure that all used assemblies reference the desired version of other assemblies that we have in our project. My favorite example for this is NHibernate, which internally uses log4net. If you also use log4net otherwise for your application&#8217;s logging  stuff, then you have to make sure that your log4net version matches the one required by the NH assembly, either through natively using it or through having the necessary version redirect in your configuration file. This alone would be simple, but as it is with big projects, the number of dependencies tends to explode&#8230;<br />
2.<br />
It is much better to package a huge amount of code into one assembly which is internally structured by namespaces, than arranging all this code into a larger number of smaller assemblies. This has many reasons &#8211; you can refer to <a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/2011/05/30/on-partitionning-net-code/" rel="nofollow">http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/2011/05/30/on-partitionning-net-code/</a> if you want to read more about it. The main reason for me is: it raises the quality of a project&#8217;s architectural design and code quality in general&#8230;</p>
<p>So, thinking twice before adding another assembly reference to a project is a matter of quality to me &#8211; and therefore a matter of doing a good job. It fights two major enemies of software development at once: Complexity in general and dependencies in particular.</p>
<p>And no, I don&#8217;t really care if others are doing it differently. This does not necessarily mean that they are doing it better or have better reasons&#8230; </p>

<p>I do not doubt the affect that dependencies on differing versions can have on this topic; however I don&#8217;t believe that &#8220;lumping&#8221; all your code into one assembly (especially if you have the intention of sharing it) is the right thing to do (architecturally or otherwise).</p>

<p>This is definitely a cultural thing and a lack of a decent package manager or a choice of package manager is part of the problem.  Ruby gems, rvm and bundler make importing gems almost too easy.  This does not mean you don&#8217;t still have problems and the high abstraction means when it does go wrong, you can feel pretty lost but it is a great system.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve still some way to go in .NET and I personally use openwrap.  The use of a good DVCS like git is important.  As branching is cheap, we can easily branch off and run some spikes without much disruption.</p>
<p>Sadly few of us in .NET use git or mercurial and TFS is unlikely to get its act together or go away.</p>

And the most trouble we had with assembly references is at creating patches for existing customer installations. We use third-party packages for ui and some special operations and every integration of a new release of these packages leads to an immense effort in creating the patches for our delivered solutions or even breakes the upgrade chain (using real patches, not a new full setup).<br />
As Workaround we&#8217;ve started to combine the third-party assemblys from one vendor to one assembly, so that we&#8217;ve only one reference to that package in the solution which can be replaced more easily on upgrade needs. This works for some of our third-party elements, unfortunately not for all (Architekture or Licensing causes).<br />
The next point is the problem behavior with plugins. Some of our Solutions use Plugins which are separated as assemblys. References to a third-party assembly in the Master App and in the Plugin must be always at the same level, which means, we have to update the plugin, even if it runs fine, when updating the references of the main app. Rolling out these updates is also very complicated (ever tried to update a gac entry with a setup patch?)<br />
I would like to see a version compatibility info direct on the referenced assembly, like &#8220;this is v3.4.1.6 and it is backward compatible in interfaces down to version v3.4.0.0&#8243;, this would save us a lot of time for reference handling. The current mechanism with machine-, app- and gac.config respective policies for reference remapping is to time-consuming to handle. I thinks thats one point why you mostly see no patches instead of full setups with small version steps.</p>

If you&#8217;ve ever tried to upgrade NHibernate 2 to NHibernate 3 in a solution with thirty projects, you&#8217;ll know just how painful it gets. Even worse, NHibernate 2.0 to NHibernate 2.2 where extra assemblies were introduced (e.g. NHibernate.ByteCode.Castle). Then in the same project I found two different copies of the same version of NHibernate in different places were being referenced by different projects, resulting in warnings about conflicting references that were almost impossible to locate.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think a lot of assemblies in your project will have much of an impact on runtime performance, but it will certainly have a negative impact on compilation times. The compiler re-loads (and re-copies) all the references for each project in your solution, so for a large project, the time to do this will increase as O(n^2).</p>

What I mean is: You have to manage more *reference instances* when having your code distributed across many assemblies. <br />
If you divide your code into assembly A and B, then you might to have reference assembly C from both, and you also have to take care that no version mismatch is occuring during runtime. If you instead put all your code into one assembly, you need to reference assembly C only once, and you wouldn&#8217;t have to care about versions.<br />
On the other hand, it&#8217;s of course also true that it is a bad thing if I would be forced to satisfy a bunch of useless dependencies, only because a referenced assembly would require this.</p>
<p>My strong experience is: The less assembly references you have to manage in a project, the better. But this does not mean that there cannot be strong reasons to isolate certain chunks of functionality, especially if you want to share it across projects, as you mentioned.<br />
What I primarily had in mind &#8211; and I&#8217;ve seen this much too often &#8211; are solutions which have dozens of projects with only a few classes each, and the code will be used exclusively by that solution. This really is a severe architectural smell. &#8211; I can remember one situation when I spent two days only to figure out the runtime dependencies on such a solution&#8217;s build server&#8230;</p>

<p>As someone else said, splitting a solution into many assemblies does not a better architecture make. My experience is that the architecture is generally worse, when projects are used as a code organisation tool. You should only make exes and dlls that make sense from a physical POV. E.g will this all ever be updated by itself, or replaced by a substitute, etc? If the answer is no, then it shouldn&#8217;t be a separate assembly.</p>
<p>There are two problems with too many projects in a solution. One is compile time, and the other is dependency issues.</p>
<p>I have recently worked on code with both these issues. The solution (not that big in LOC terms), took up to 20 minutes to compile. </p>
<p>It also had an issue where the dependency of one assembly on another was the wrong way round, and as a result, there were functions that had 50 or so parameters, and all sorts of other crap. Fixing this one dependency issue we estimated would take about 3 man-months, and run the risk of breaking the application entirely (naturally, this type of code had no unit tests!).</p>
<p>Had they just been namespaces in the one assembly, then most of the problem code just would&#8217;t have happened.</p>
<p>Moral of the story? Only create executables and DLLs when you actually need them. Using them for code organisational purposes only is a BAD IDEA. That&#8217;s what namespaces are for.</p>
<p>Too many people should create a new folder, and create a new project instead.</p>

I think this is partly a cultural aspect, package management tooling is just taking off now (with NuGet) while in the Java community it seems like this has been engrained for some time (using Maven repositories for example). </p>
<p>Secondly, and this may be specific to our company, is the legal issues. Every open source package we want to use has to be run by our legal department to review the license, which is additional friction in using external tools.</p>
<p>As for performance, the big hit is cold startup time (e.g. after a reboot).  Cold Startup time is (roughly) Warm Start Time + Disk IO so the more dependencies you have the longer the startup time.  If you&#8217;re requiring strongly named assemblies, the whole assembly has to be loaded for strong name verification.     In our case cold start time was 25 seconds, warm start time was 5 seconds.  This can be reduced by putting things in the GAC (thereby skipping the need for additional verification), but then the GAC causes other problems if you have multiple versions of the same assembly in use (a new form of DLL hell).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the people at our company that want to reduce the external dependencies seem to be the same ones who want to break solutions into many tiny projects.  I&#8217;m looking at a solution right now with 50 projects, many are very small (in fact one has exactly one class, with no methods, and two constants).  This decomposition has the (noble) goal of matching the physical design  and logical design of the application.  The downside (as Thomas Weller has already mentioned) is that this decomposition results in increased build times, and painful deployment.</p>

However, in practice, this isn&#8217;t always possible. Hiding NHibernate behind a single abstraction layer means that either (a) you have to limit yourself to a subset of functionality which will prove to be almost useless if you need to do any meaningful performance optimisation (ie avoiding SELECT n+1 problems all over the place) or else (b) you have to make your abstraction layer so complex and specific that it&#8217;s another whole level of DRY violations in itself.</p>
<p>Besides, I&#8217;m just using NHibernate as one example. There are a lot of other things that could cause the same problems: logging frameworks and IOC containers, to give just two examples.</p>

<p>Also, the team is using &#8220;Developer Productivity&#8221; as a &#8220;metric&#8221; on how easy it is to maintain while developing the project. Definitely interested in further thoughts.  </p>

Separate assemblies are only needed if multiple apps need to share them. OO separation of concerns is handles with class/namespace/module &#8211; do we need all this assembly-level modularisation? At the cost of 10% of our development budget?</p>
<p>Size and load times have similar relationships.</p>
<p>We obfuscate our app to protect it. Put it all in one massive file and we&#8217;d get a bit more security through obscurity. So why do we break up our apps into hundreds of tiny dlls with names like &#8220;MyApp.Licensing.dll&#8221; or &#8220;MyApp.TopSecretAlgorithm.dll&#8221; that take the hacker directly to the code they want to reverse engineer?</p>
<p>But for me the biggie is this: .net References are a complete pain in the backside. Even a reference pointing at a *specific file* results in a probe sequence that reaches out past mars and pluto to see if it can pluck an old incompatible version of the dll out of the ether. If there is a wrong copy of a single dll anywhere on your network, you can guarantee that one day your build, for no obvious reason, will use that dll instead of just using the exact the file you pointed it at. On several occasions our application has crashed and burned when one of our 170 dlls has linked inexplicably to a completely incorrect (missing) version of a referenced dll. We only found this through manually testing every feature for every release. We now build in a &#8220;clean&#8221; environment where old versions of dlls are not allowed to be present anywhere on our build server&#8217;s filesystem, and the problem has not recurred. Why can&#8217;t the reference just use the exact filename we gave it?!</p>

It seems to me like in that case, it would actually be better to have lots of small files that you all use rather than less big files, that you are not going to entirely use.<br />
As far as Orchard is concerned, I&#8217;ve long wanted to have a lightweight plugin system relying on a dynamic language model, for this kind of reason, so that many small extensions have minimal impact (we actually had that on early prototypes).<br />
Oh, and there is the problem that you can&#8217;t unload an assembly, whereas most scripting engines make garbage collecting code easy.</p>

In the F# stuff I&#8217;ve been working on, I&#8217;ve started thinking of my files as &#8220;assemblies.&#8221; With the ability to publish files as Content in NuGet packages, it&#8217;s possible to start including files as dependencies directly into your code base. No ILMerge needed to get a single, deployable .dll or .exe.</p>
<p>The question will certainly arise as to why in the world anyone would want to shove a lot of stuff into a single file. Well, it works pretty well in F#, as in a number of dynamic languages. Also, with tools like R#, there&#8217;s really no point worrying over file organization when you can easily navigate to any part of your code base. I&#8217;m sure others will disagree, but it&#8217;s working for me. (Sorry for the derailment there at the end.)</p>
