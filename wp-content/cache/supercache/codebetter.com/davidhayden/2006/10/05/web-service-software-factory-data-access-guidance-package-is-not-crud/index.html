He mentions a couple of things:</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;I thought that object orientation was already accepted as good practice, but here comes Microsoft splitting up data and behavior once again. Business components that have only behavior, and business entities that contain only data (relationships between entities doesn&#039;t count as behavior) &lt;shudder/&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just because there&#039;s a factory that autogenerates thousands of lines of code, doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re the right thousands of lines of code.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, personally, interpret his concerns not so much about the <strong>code generated</strong>, but the <strong>architecture,</strong> although I could be wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft tends to separate behavior and data, which&nbsp;is contrary to&nbsp;<a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2006/03/14/2884.aspx">OOP</a> as Udi points out. We end up with all these separate projects and classes with data here and behavior there. In the solution generated by the Web Service Software Factory, there is an obvious separation of these concerns into separate entity and implementation projects.</p>
<p>To be fair to the Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices Team, I read in the Web Service Software Factory Forums that they broke the architecture into serveral small projects for a reason other than to suggest you use it. They figured it was easier for a developer to remove and consolidate projects than to create new ones. Hence, they&nbsp;&quot;are&quot;&nbsp;thinking more about productivity in generating all the projects as oppose to saying you need all those projects.</p>
<p>Other than the layout of the projects, there is no &quot;behavior&quot; generated, other than DAL code which we will get into it a minute. One is free to remove the &quot;implementation&quot; projects and assign behavior to the&nbsp;entity classes using the domain model and <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2006/07/03/ApplyingDomainDrivenDesignAndPatterns.aspx">Domain-Driven Design</a> if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Data Access Layer</strong></p>
<p>In DDD,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;the persistence services offered by a&nbsp;Data Access Layer&nbsp;are handled by&nbsp;repositories, which delineate aggregate boundaries and handle persistence. Udi doesn&#039;t acknolwedge the existence of a DAL ( hence his concern ),&nbsp;but rather Repositories, which&nbsp;are first-class citizens in the domain.</p>
<p>I like that, too, but again, I think of this as more of an architectural issue as oppose to the actual code generated by Web Service Software Factory. As I will mention below, you can easily move the code in the Data Access layer up into the domain model as DDD Repositories with little effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Code Generated</strong></p>
<p>So here is the heart of my previous post &#8211; the code generated, not the architecture / solution generated by the Web Service Software Factory.</p>
<p>We have 3 very helpful items generated in the <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2006/09/23/DataAccessGuidancePackageCodeGeneration.aspx">Data Access Guidance Package</a>: 1) Store Procedures, 2) Simple Persistent Ignorant Business Entities, and Repositories ( one for each business entity ).</p>
<p><strong>Store Procedures</strong> &#8211; Now regardless of what you think of stored procedures, some developers and organizations love them, want them, need them. Many of them in an application become associated with CRUD ( and I mean Create, Update, and Delete <img src='http://codebetter.com/davidhayden/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . If you need them for whatever reason, I&#039;ll be dang if you want to manually create them one by one. The Data Access Guidance Package to the rescue if you don&#039;t have another way in your toolbox. How can you argue with the optional free productivity boost for those who want stored procedures? You may not agree with their use, so you can choose not to use the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Business Entities</strong> &#8211; Even if you use NHibernate or other <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/category/24.aspx?Show=All">O/R Mapper</a>, often and most likely your business entities will match 1:1 with database tables. Even if they don&#039;t, generating business entities 1:1 for each table is the way to jumpstart the modeling of the domain. And, because you as the developer are in charge of assigning behavior, the best that can be done is creating persistent ignorant entities with just data ( one property per table column ). Again, this is what the Data Access Guidance Package does for you. It is not suggesting you don&#039;t add behavior, only that it is your job <img src='http://codebetter.com/davidhayden/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  You also decide what relationships you want to honor between entities. It could possibly add the relationships&nbsp;for us&nbsp;and allow us to&nbsp;strip away unwanted ones as a productivity boost, but&nbsp;adding relationships is&nbsp;certainly not as tedious as adding properties.</p>
<p><strong>Repositories and Factories</strong> &#8211; The repositories generated by the Data Access Guidance Package can be your DDD Repositories. It generates one per domain object. You may want to change this to one per aggregate. Not a big deal. I would rather they generate 1 per domain object and let me consolidate as necessary as it makes me more productive. Because the code is well refactored to base classes and separation of concerns via the <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2005/05/29/1066.aspx">Single-Responsibility Principle</a> ( SRP ), you will get some base classes, small specialized classes implementing interfaces, and the interface contracts. This is all OOP and a side-effect of well&nbsp;refactored classes with one responsibility. We &quot;hate&quot; to see this base code that is usually hidden in the assembly of your favorite <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/category/24.aspx?Show=All">O/R Mapper</a>, but it is there regardless of how it is hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, I agree with Udi and many of his points, but I think his comments are hopefully not about the code, but the solution / architecture and what it &quot;implies&quot; when you first look at it. It implies a separation of data and behavior which goes against all we hear about in OOP. I must admit, I didn&#039;t pick up on it like Udi, but definitely see it now and appreciate him mentioning it.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn&#039;t let that stop you from using the <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/category/15.aspx?Show=All">code generation</a> and the code generated if it can help you. It will work with DDD or the Three Layered Services Application that Microsoft tends to recommend. You choose which works best for you.</p>

<p>I pleade the 5th amendment because I have friends and colleagues who feel very passionate about both ways and this will only get me in trouble <img src='http://codebetter.com/davidhayden/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I can hear them now. One says that if you are not doing messages you aren&#8217;t doing SOA. The other is saying, where I tend to lean, leverage the power of your domain model.</p>
<p>Udi Dahan talks about this all the time. I recommend checking out his blog for insight &#8211; <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/" rel="nofollow">http://udidahan.weblogs.us/</a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>David,</p>
<p>How do you think about using a service interface with messages for every client (even if you are writing one app)? The extra data types makes it loosely coupled but you loose the mobile business object principle (Distributed objects). This principle I find in CSLA (Lhotka) and in DevForce from IdeaBlade and I find it very productive because business rules are not duplicated.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>(Directed towards the topic and not you David)</p>
<p>I think as long as P&#038;P Releases software, ppl are going to complain because it&#8217;s not coinciding with their preference.   And they aren&#8217;t going to be pleasing everyone.  What bothers me is that if you have a problem with it, they always ask for feedback long before they release something, so stick around their community and be active.  </p>
<p>Chatter heard when something P&#038;P released:</p>
<p>CAB &#8211; it&#8217;s too complicated, too much of a learning curve<br />
ObjectBuilder &#8211;  it&#8217;s not like Spring, it tries to do too much</p>
<p>EntLib &#8211;<br />
Logger &#8211; too slow, it&#8217;s not log4net<br />
Data &#8211; It tries to do too much, I liked it better when it was just the MSDAAB Helper class<br />
Configuration &#8211; It&#8217;s a configuration nightmare<br />
Deployment &#8211; Doesn&#8217;t work in medium trust out of the box<br />
Configurator Tool &#8211; Isn&#8217;t intuitive and good luck finding out when you have an invalid configuration.<br />
And now the guidance packages: bwak bwak bwak.<br />
etc. etc. </p>
<p>Like David mentioned, there are usually reasons behind decisions in architecture, if you care that much to criticize, be involved.  The truth of the matter is yes, it might not be 100% perfect and also meet everyone&#8217;s needs.   But they sure make it easy to start plugging away in many different parts of your architecture.   If there is that silver bullet that addresses a comparable offering against all of their deliverables, I sure as heck would like to know about it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The comment &#8220;generating business entities 1:1 for each table is the way to jumpstart the modeling of the domain&#8221; assumes that you created the database first, which isn&#8217;t very Domain Driven, is it?  It is Data Driven, which is one of the problems with the WSSF.  Now, yes I know that we can use NHibernate to generate the DDL, which would make it Domain Driven, but that isn&#8217;t the case in this example.  I also know that the majority of developers start &#8220;from the bottom&#8221; and work up, so I do see the value in WSSF, but we really should use the Guidance Automation Toolkit to create our own DDD version of WSSF (we being the people complaining about WSSF not being DDD).</p>
