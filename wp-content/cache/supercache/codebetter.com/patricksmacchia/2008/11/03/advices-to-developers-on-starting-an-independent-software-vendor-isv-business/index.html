<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">As a developer (and if<br />
you read my blog there are good chances you are a developer) you have an<br />
enormous potential to start a company. I think that most developers don’t realize<br />
how big this potential is. I started an ISV business by selling the tool<br />
<a href="http://www.NDepend.com" target="_blank">NDepend </a>for .NET<br />
developers. I am still in the process of making the business growing and it is<br />
a great adventure. I would like to expose in this blog post some advices that could<br />
help a developer doing so.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><b><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="EN-US">The cost of developing and selling software</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">What do you need to start<br />
developing a software? A good PC, some development tools and an internet connection. Maximum<br />
3000US$ investment (that you certainly have already invested). Most other<br />
engineering industries needs millions of $ investment. Think of the cost of<br />
starting a business of physical assets like electronic devices.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Minimal<br />
investment </span><span lang="EN-US">is a good incentive but the biggest advantage of<br />
software over others engineering industries comes from the cost of unit. What does it cost to build one license<br />
of a software? 0 US$. What does it cost to build 1.000 licenses of a<br />
software? 0 US$.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">I am caricaturing and the<br />
provocation is intentional. Of course the cost of doing software is the<br />
investment made in development. Also, if you have 10.000 users, the cost of the<br />
support will certainly be 10 times the cost of supporting 1.000 users. Concerning<br />
the support it is all about making it scale. The experience we have with our<br />
tool, shows that playing the agility rules largely pays. <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/ReleaseNotes.aspx" target="_blank">Releasing often</a></span><span lang="EN-US"> to make sure that all bugs reported<br />
are fixed, investing in the quality, investing in a neat UI by listening carefully<br />
to feedback, making sure to update the documentation each time a user ask a<br />
question, yes it pays. The number of questions asked and bug reported stays<br />
small and is not increasing linearly with the number of users.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><b><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="EN-US">Advantages of becoming an ISV over doing<br />
another software development job</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Before digging further, I<br />
would like to underline the advantages of being an ISV over being a consultant,<br />
an employee or a trainer? Here are my thoughts:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm 1pt 36pt;text-indent: -18pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol" lang="EN-US"><span>·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US">You<br />
spend most of the time doing what you really like, coding.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm 1pt 36pt;text-indent: -18pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol" lang="EN-US"><span>·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US">Freedom! There is nobody to tell you what you should work on, when you should<br />
work or the amount of quality you want to put in your code. You can also (more than<br />
less) choose who you want to work with and the location from where you are<br />
working. South of France or a tropical island, nobody cares except you. The availability<br />
of a decent and reliable internet connection is the only limit.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm 1pt 36pt;text-indent: -18pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol" lang="EN-US"><span>·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US">Day<br />
after day, you capitalize on a code base and you can begin dream on. Successful<br />
small ISVs business sometime end up being bought by bigger companies.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm 1pt 36pt;text-indent: -18pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol" lang="EN-US"><span>·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US">The<br />
amount of incoming money is not proportional to the work put in it. If the software<br />
doesn’t sell well this is a very bad point. But in the case of successful sales,<br />
it can be much more income than any consultancy position. The reason is clear:<br />
as explained below, you can make it so that selling 1 or 1000 licenses cost you<br />
the same price. Software is the only industry that makes this magic possible. Is<br />
it by chance that the richest man in the world during the last 13 years was<br />
primarily a software developer?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm 1pt 36pt;text-indent: -18pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol" lang="EN-US"><span>·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US">Starting<br />
a business tends to be a positive point on a CV. Even if your business fails it<br />
doesn’t mean that you lost some time in your career. During a job interview you<br />
can ramble on the courage and motivation you had starting such an adventure and<br />
what you learnt on the way. Many interviewers you’ll meet are employee forever that might be impressed by what you dared.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><b><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="EN-US">Controlling the human factor</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">The only human factor you<br />
can control is your own motivation. How can you prevent anyone on earth<br />
potentially ruining your business? The answer I found is to multiply the number<br />
of clients. This is only possible if the price for a license is affordable,<br />
like a few hundreds of US$. The other option is to have a few clients and to sale<br />
expensive licenses. But then instead of having a powerful boss, you get a <i>powerful client</i> and here come the human<br />
factor.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Don’t take me wrong here<br />
on the term <i>powerful client</i>. For<br />
example, we are constantly striving to give power to NDepend users by <a href="/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/10/13/listen-to-your-users.aspx" target="_blank">listening<br />
very carefully to any client feedback</a></span><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/10/13/listen-to-your-users.aspx"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><span> <span lang="EN-US">and do our best to satisfy each<br />
of their requests. Satisfying one user results in satisfying all users. On the<br />
other hand there is no user with enough power to impair our business. There is<br />
no user that invested more than a few hundreds or thousands of US$. If it<br />
happens that a company asks for its money back, this is not a problem.<br />
Hopefully it has never been even close to happen.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Sometime you don’t have<br />
the choice on the range of clients: your idea of software will only help a few<br />
dozens of users, maybe important users that can pay hundreds of thousands of<br />
US$ licenses (like design tools for semiconductor). My opinion on this: forget<br />
it! If less than several dozens of thousands potential users and independent companies, then you will<br />
expose yourself to the <i>human factor</i>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><b><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="EN-US">Reducing the risk to almost 0</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">What is the biggest risk?<br />
Quitting your job for a poor business and not being able to recover a job as<br />
good as you had. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">I would be scary to do<br />
some B2C (Business to Customer) software, even though the range of customers is<br />
virtually millions. Something like video game for mobile phones, real-estate<br />
web agency or web search engine. Last decade has proven that successful B2C software<br />
earn billions of US$ per year. On the other hand, the risk is extremely high.<br />
It is like playing lottery. How many web search engines do you use? How many<br />
web search engines projects have been started and failed?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">The safer solution is to<br />
find a B2B (Business to Business) market, to target professional users. You need<br />
to provide a software with an affordable license price (100/500 US$ per seat)<br />
that can save a few hours a week of some professional users. Professional users<br />
won’t hesitate to spend of few hundred US$ to save a few hours a week. To<br />
reduce the risk closer to 0, my advice is to start providing a free version of<br />
your software on the web. Then you can wait 6 to 12 months to see if indeed your<br />
software is able to get a few thousands of download. This will show if there is<br />
a real demand for what you want to do or if the usefulness of your software is<br />
just the product of your imagination. A bit of free marketing here (articles on<br />
specialized web sites, enthusiast’s bloggers reviews, user group presentations…)<br />
is needed for cranking what you are looking for: the <i>word to mouth effect</i>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">This is what happened <i>accidently</i> for NDepend. At the<br />
beginning, 4 years and half ago, I developed a simple tool in a few days to<br />
compute a few metrics on a .NET code base. At that time, I was consulting on a<br />
large code base and part of my job was to help improving quality. Then I put<br />
the tool on the web simply because there were no reasons to not sharing it with<br />
others developers. One year and a half later, a few thousands of developers<br />
were interested in it. Some of them were very enthusiast about it. I realized<br />
that a small (but existing) percentage of them would be happy to pay a few<br />
hundreds bucks to have a more sophisticated tool to control precisely their<br />
code structure and quality. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Do the math, a small<br />
percentage of a few thousands users a year, ready to spend a few hundreds of US$ each:<br />
it is enough to start making a living on it, and consequently it is enough to<br />
quit your job to work full time on it and with a bit of luck, starting hiring.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><b><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="EN-US">Deciding what your software will do</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">This is by far the most critical<br />
point. You absolutely need 2 fields of expertise: the ability of developing good<br />
software but also a strong competence on the field targeted by your product. A<br />
seasoned software developer usually lacks the second expertise. Which kind of<br />
professional users will your software help? Architect? Manager? Health pro? Insurance<br />
pro? Transportation pro? Financial pro? Administrator? Accounter? Security pro?<br />
Lawyer? Then you need to be associated with someone as motivated as you are and<br />
with many years of professional experience in the targeted field.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">We all saw several<br />
successful projects (in terms of sales) made by non-expert development team. I consulted<br />
in the past for a software company that made many millions of US$ a year by<br />
developing and selling a tool that made the life of Lotus Notes administrators<br />
a bit easer! What your software will do and how it will do is much more important<br />
than how it is developed. A very well coded software that is not useful to<br />
anyone is a failure. Hopefully having a sane development certainly helps satisfying<br />
more users and be able to add important features often.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">The market of software<br />
tools for developers is unique. Indeed, a developer can hold both the capacity<br />
to do the software and the expertise to imagine how to make the life of developers<br />
easier. The downside is that doing a tool for developers is very challenging<br />
because there are plenty of talented guys that already had many ideas. I<br />
wouldn’t even think of trying to start a project to compete with tools like <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/" target="_blank">Reflector</a></span><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><span lang="EN-US">, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper" target="_blank">Resharper<span style="text-decoration: underline">,</span></a></span><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Coding_Assistance/" target="_blank">CodeRush </a></span><span lang="EN-US">, <a href="http://devexpress.com/Products/NET/DXperience/" target="_blank">DXPerience</a></span><a href="http://devexpress.com/Products/NET/DXperience/" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://devexpress.com/Products/NET/DXperience/" target="_blank">, </a><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/" target="_blank">dotTrace</a></span><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/" target="_blank">, </a><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_profiler/index.htm%20" target="_blank">ANTS Profiler</a>, </span><a href="http://www.preemptive.com/dotfuscator.html" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a href="http://www.preemptive.com/dotfuscator.html" target="_blank"><span><span lang="EN-US">Dotfuscator</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.preemptive.com/dotfuscator.html" target="_blank">, </a><a href="http://www.sd.nl/software/default.asp" target="_blank">Llblgen</a>,<br />

of many man-years of super talented developers. If you start a promising tool,<br />
some competitors will come and challenge you anyway. But at the beginning, it is your choice to<br />
avoid any field where some solid and recognized competitors are already there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 1pt 0cm"><span lang="EN-US">However, each new<br />
