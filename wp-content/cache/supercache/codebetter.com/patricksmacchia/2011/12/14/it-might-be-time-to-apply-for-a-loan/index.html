If you read CodeBetter you are certainly a programmer, making and saving money with your coding skills and your energy. I’d like to talk about a few things related to money and especially loan. The point is that getting in debt is essential in life. In this time of crisis, where millions of people got ruined because of their loan, I don’t want to sound ironic. The secret is to get in debt with a <strong>fixed interest rate loan</strong>. The important word is <strong>fixed</strong>. Why? Because of inflation!</p>
<h2>A word on Inflation</h2>
<p>Inflation is the measure of the fact that the price of everything increase over time. Something that costs 2 bucks today, used to cost 1 buck a few years ago and will cost 3 bucks in a few years, we all know that. If you talk with your dad and ask the amount of salary he got, you might be surprise to hear it was a just a fraction of your salary today.</p>
<p>For example, your dad as an engineer was paid 25.000 US$ a year 20 years ago while you get pay 70.000 US$ today. 20 years ago, to purchase your dream&#8217;s house, a loan worth 8.000US$ a year over 20 years was enough. But today the same loan for the same house could cost well 30.000US$ a year. The amazing thing with fixed rate, is that, if today you were about to pay the last annual fee for your 20 years fixed rate loan contracted in 1991, it would cost only 8.000US$. If it was a variable rate loan, you could be well paying much more instead! So with a fixed rate loan, the higher the inflation is, the more you win. <strong>Getting in a long term fixed rate loan is the way to see inflation as something positive.</strong></p>
<p>So what can we say about the near future of inflation? Nowadays, both US and Europe states got into an insane debt level. The US debt alone is worth 15.000 Billions US$ while something as ground-breaking and successful as Microsoft, Google or Apple ranges in the 100 Billions US$. The following <em>famous</em> picture represents the US debt stacked in 100US$ bills:<br />
<a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/USDebt.jpg"><img src="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/USDebt.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="380" /></a><br />
There is absolutely no way these debts will be honored properly. What could happen is debt canceling, which could provoke a war with say, China that owns a large portion of the debt. More preferably and more realistically, what will happen is that government will provoke more inflation. Nobody likes inflation, because it ruins people, corporations and economy. Remember? the only winners in case of inflation are those who have a lot of debts.</p>
<p>Actually during the last 25 years<strong> inflation has been kept low artificially</strong>, because states changed their strategy and borrowed to tiers actors like banks and other states, instead of borrowing to themselves. Indeed, before that period states used to borrow to themselves by provoking inflation. The result of this new strategy is the insane debts. More inflation is something governments know how to start, by printing more money, but don’t know how to stop. Hence they are still reluctant to go back again with inflation, but inflation is the only chance to give the global debt less value, and maybe get the head out of this situation one day.</p>
<p>If you look at historical US inflation, you’ll see low 3% to 5% rate since 1985, while it used to be up to 13,58% in 1980 and even more after the two world wars. I produce this US inflation graph from 1914 to 2010, from data available here, : <a href="http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/HistoricalInflation.aspx">http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/HistoricalInflation.aspx</a><br />
<a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/InflationHistoric.jpg"><img src="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/InflationHistoric.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="335" /></a></p>
<p>If you contract say, a 4% interest rate loan today, each future annual inflation rate above 4% will make you richer. And as said, there are serious reasons to think that inflation rate will grow insanely soon. Inflation rate above 10% has been reached not so long ago, this is clearly part of the possible.</p>
<h2>Visualizing Compound Interests</h2>
<p>Recently, me and my relatives had the chance to contract a few fixed rate loans, and I got pretty interested into the math beyond it. It is actually pretty basic math, but still, <em>Einstein</em> called compound interest:  <strong>the greatest mathematical discovery of all time</strong>. To my disappointment, I found zero compelling offers on the web to quickly play with loan parameters (amount/term/rate) and get an immediate visualization of the impact on the loan cost. Weird but true: <em>There is no good offer to visualize properly what is certainly the most important financial decision anyone has to take?!</em></p>
<p>This is why with a friend working in the financial area we created the free site <a href="http://www.loanfor.us/">http://www.loanfor.us/</a> in English and <a href="http://www.simulcredit.fr/">http://www.simulcredit.fr/</a> in French. At a glance, you can see that if you get a 20 years long loan for 300K US$, the loan amortization will look like that with a 4% annual interest rate:<br />
<a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-461" src="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu11.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="254" /></a><br />
And like that with a 8% annual interest rate:<br />
<a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-462" src="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu21.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>And like that with a 12% annual interest rate:</p>
<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-464" src="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu4.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>The orange area represents <strong><span style="color: #ff6600">the cost of the interest of the credit</span></strong>, while the green area represents <strong><span style="color: #339966">the 300K borrowed</span></strong>. With an interactive calculator it is clear that the interest cost are not 4%, 8% nor 12% of 300K, which are 12K, 24K and 36K. The interest cost are 154K, 320K and 511K or 52%, 107% and 170% of the amount borrowed!</p>
<p><strong>Imagine to give away 511K to have the chance to reimburse 300K!!!</strong> My dad said that 30 years ago, it was not exceptional that the interest cost could grow up to 200% of the amount borrowed. Of course, in these conditions assets like real estate prices are decreasing. On the other side, nowadays nobody is trusting finance and economy anymore, and with gold, real estate remains a compelling investment, which makes real estate price increasing. With these two opposite trending playing against each other, today nobody can predict how assets or gold prices will evolve.</p>
<p>Another interesting graph is the monthly repayments vs. the loan term vs. total credit cost, below in yellow.<br />
<a href="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu35.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-467" src="http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2011/12/Simu35.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="532" /></a><br />
There is a balance here, between <em>short term high monthly repayments</em> and <em>long term high total credit cost</em>, choose one. Because of the potential future high inflation, my bet is that long term like 15 to 25 years are preferable. It is also preferable because this way you can borrow more and purchase more and bigger assets today.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>Thanks for following my reasoning; it is now time to go back to cool coding activity. But make sure to free up some brain cycles to mull over all this, because no matter how hard you are working to make money and save money, if you don’t invest money properly <strong>today</strong> you are taking high risks. Putting money at the bank means that bank owes you money, and getting in debt means that you owe money to the bank.</p>
<p>I am not a financial expert but no expert can predict the future of finance, else the world wouldn’t be there. Please don’t take my advices for granted <strong>I might be well totally wrong</strong>. But it is certainly worth defining <strong>your own</strong> opinion and financial strategy based on facts, not based on what others say. Those who have been called finance expert didn&#8217;t predict the major crisis we are now facing for 3 years. Bother to listen to one advice only if you have a proof that one is applying the advice to himself.</p>

 reason is that inflation gave a solid advantage to the first ones, but<br />
this is something not trivial to pinpoint.</p>

<p>1) You have to think about the Net Present Value (NPV) of money.  When you say you are paying 500k to get 300k in money it&#8217;s not entirely accurate.  You are paying 500k *over 20 years* to get 300k *today*.  The NPV of 500k over 20 years is significantly less than 500k today.</p>
<p>2) You can&#8217;t count on inflation going up in the near future, that is trying to predict the economy, which is folly for anybody who is not an expert.  If you truly believed that you knew that inflation will increase in the near future, there are financial instruments where you can effectively &#8220;bet&#8221; on this.  If you were confident this was true, the best thing you could do is not get some loans, but go invest in a financial instrument that will pay off if your prediction comes true.  Doing this though is effectively saying you know more than wall street about what is going to happen to inflation.</p>

as said I don&#8217;t believe expert advice can help because this is not a science like math or software programming. Very few experts predicted sub-primes and the current crisis. I&#8217;d say we can call those who predicted right lucky.</p>
<p>There is one undoubted fact, an insane level of debt for US and Europe, and looking back at history, high debt usually lead to war or high inflation. Of course the second option would be preferable and I am betting on it.</p>

<p>What about not borrowing?<br />
If you don&#8217;t borrow money, you pay zero percent interest.  That&#8217;s a good rate.  And it&#8217;s the same every time, last I did the math.  </p>
<p>And what about the opportunity cost????<br />
For example:  Lets take the same $1893 per month and invest it in a good diversified mutual fund plan at 8% (which is a reasonable average over 10 or 20 year period, BTW).  In 30 years, you&#8217;d have $2,840,058!  And $2,158,578 of that was interested received!  </p>
<p>I realize, in some cases there are things as to why you&#8217;re getting a loan that offset the opportunity.  For example, if you didn&#8217;t get a mortgage on your home, you&#8217;d need to rent.  But let&#8217;s play with that too, to be fair.  How about a $1300 monthly rent payment with utilities being constant compared to the house?  That&#8217;s still $392 you could invest each month.  Compounded over 30 years at 8% is $889,675.12.  Just food for thought.</p>
<p>But my concern is the assumption that &#8220;debt is essential in life&#8221;.  I<br />
believe that is what the culture thinks is true, but it isn&#8217;t.  There are people and businesses<br />
that manage to do very well (if not better) in life&#8230;without any debt.</p>
<p>Debt is not essential, it&#8217;s dumb.</p>

<p>Sure, making more money from your own business is always the best solution, bust applicable for just a few lucky.<br />
But there are also plenty of old people with plenty of assets that didn&#8217;t wait to be old to acquire their assets.

<p>Good Mutual funds are diverse stock profiles and have been able to recover after each recession pretty quickly.  More so than the news shows since they focus on single bad days or single companies.</p>
<p>But asset speculation is what got us into the economic recession we&#8217;re in.  You know that right?  People around me kept saying, buy as much house as you can because they&#8217;re only going up in value.  Shoot, with that logic, even a ARM variable interest rate makes sense, right?  It&#8217;ll be worth so much more in a few years.  So I&#8217;ll get me a sub-prime and get me the most house that rate can afford. </p>

<p>The world is currently experiencing debt-deflation &#8211; people realized they&#8217;ve amassed to much debt, and therefore demand cash to straighten out their balance sheets; the fed supplies it to them. Look for Michael Pettis&#8217; blog, he does a way better job of explaining this than I ever could.</p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-1496" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I realized that when writing the last comment.  I wasn&#8217;t addressing the fixed vs. variable argument.  We agree on fixed vs variable.  Sub-prime was just an example of a symptom of speculation on the housing market, which hurt more than just the sub-prime and their contractors.  And actually, because we both disagree with variable rate loans, it&#8217;s speaking to my point  &#8211; that we get stupid when we speculate on things going up or down, taking on more risk than it appears, even for those not taking out sub-prime.  Many people ended up upside down on their mortgages because of the quick decrease in home values.  And I agree with you, that the financial systems involved are to be blamed.  I don&#8217;t trust them because they speculated on this market big-time and used all sorts of financial products and packages that, once upon a time, were not allowed (recent deregulation done by both sides of the isle opened up some of the causes to our issues).  That does not make all financial institutes bad, much like a few jerks on a sports team makes the sport itself bad.  Mutual funds are powerful, conservative, steady winning products where it&#8217;s really really hard to lose money.</p>
<p>On the numbers, I agree with you as I said.  I&#8217;m just sharing my opinion through this specific context.  I hope you don&#8217;t mind.  I don&#8217;t intend to offend, but I hope I can bring about the other side of the coin that the world is starting to see a bit more these days&#8230;Including myself&#8230;that the game of debt isn&#8217;t so fun.  Maybe we should be more careful with it.  Maybe&#8230;just maybe&#8230;even avoid it when possible, because&#8230;</p>
<p>The borrower is slave to the lender</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say borrowing is evil or wrong.  It just calls it what it is, something we probably should avoid.</p>

<p>The current crisis will provoke something very wrong, some changes in our US/Europe way of living, because the states&#8217; debts cannot be reimbursed, this is mathematic, whatever the FED (US) or BCE  (EU) forecast. Somehow we have to pay the bill of 25 years of living above our means with a low inflation.</p>
<p>Certainly even mutual funds will be seriously impacted, as any financial assets, hence I&#8217;d say invest in concrete assets.</p>
<p>I consider it as a (last?) chance that long term fixed rate are still low in these conditions, and this is the point of the current blog post. This is my opinion, I can be wrong but I cannot imagine any way I could be wrong.</p>
