(Unless you&#8217;re on the ASP.NET MVC team, in which case you could offer me a job since <a href="http://www.haacked.com/archive/2008/01/23/birthday-clusters-and-code-camps.aspx" target="_blank">one of the criteria</a> for working on the team seems to be having Garnet as your birthstone).</p>
<hr />
<p>Eight years ago, I was hired for what was essentially my first full-time development job. I had dabbled with Visual Basic on and off for a year or so and&nbsp; Y2K tested Delphi for a company that didn&#8217;t trust Borland&#8217;s public statements (no, seriously) but that&#8217;s it. This was a job with a small company that sold an ASP-based learning management system with a twenty-year-old C component and some Word VBA templates. And when I say small, I mean that when I came on board, I doubled the size<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/WindowsLiveWriter/3b6831e7def1_124BD/timemachine_4.gif"><img src="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/WindowsLiveWriter/3b6831e7def1_124BD/timemachine_thumb_1.gif" style="border: 0px none" alt="timemachine" align="right" border="0" height="270" width="350"></a> of the development team. At that point, I had never laid eyes on a single line of ASP code.</p>
<p>Now, before the interview, I had actually lost the ad (it was posted in the newspaper) so I had no idea what it was about or even what the company was named (it was run out of an office in a local technical college). Note the foreshadowing&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Interviewer</b>: Did you look up anything about the company?    <br /><b>Coding Hillbilly</b>: Oh yes, of course     <br /><b>Interviewer (pleasantly surprised)</b>: Really? What did you find?     <br /><b>Coding Hillbilly</b>: That you&#8217;re&#8230;ummm&#8230;based out of&#8230;&lt;school name&gt;&#8230;and you build&#8230;stuff? </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Interviewer</b>: So I don&#8217;t see any ASP in your resume. Do you know much about it?   <br /><b>CH</b>: Oh yeah, I&#8217;ve been studying it in my free time    <br /><b>Interviewer</b>: What can you tell me about it?    <br /><b>CH</b>: &#8230;err&#8230;.that it stands for Active&#8230;.Server&#8230;.Programming? And you can&#8230;build&#8230;.stuff?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Interviewer</b>: There was another website in the job ad. Did you get a chance to take a look at it?    <br /><b>CH</b>: For sure, dude!     <br /><b>Interviewer (clearly skeptical by this point)</b>: What colours are in the logo?     <br /><b>CH</b>: &#8230;. fuchsia and mauve?    <br /><b>Interviewer</b>: Lucky guess. What do they do?    <br /><b>CH</b>: They&#8230;build&#8230;stuff?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Interviewer</b>: It&#8217;s very clear to me that you have not done any research on this company or this position. Can you tell me why I should bother to take this any further and consider you?</p>
<p>At this point, I came clean, admitted I lost the advertisement, had no idea who they were or what they did, and that I had no practical coding experience. I politely grovelled at his feet and promised to kick my own ass out of the building.</p>
<p>The offer came a couple of days later. No, seriously. They called me back and offered me the position. And that&#8217;s not even the point of this story. But give me a minute, I do have a point.</p>
<p>By that time, I had decided to stay where I was. The missus was pregnant with what we later determined was my child and moving from a big oil company with banked holidays to a near-startup that could go under at anytime didn&#8217;t seem prudent. So after a prolonged stunned silence at even being offered, I politely declined.</p>
<p>Two days later, he calls back. What will it take for me to join them? At that point, I had had feelings of regret at turning it down and my wife and I agreed that I would have taken it if they upped the offer by another $5k a year plus a week of holidays. I told him that and he says &#8220;Done&#8221;. (Later, I learned that the only reason my wife agreed to those terms was because she thought there was no hope in purgatory that they would have called back.)</p>
<p>By this time, curiosity gets the better of me and I ask the burning question: &#8220;Dude! I totally blew chunks at the interview. Why you trippin&#8217; to get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>My eventual boss for whom I gained a tremendous respect replied: To be honest, you weren&#8217;t the strongest technical candidate by a long shot. But out of all the people we interviewed, you have the best attitude and would fit in with our team. And I&#8217;ve been an educator for many years and have a hunch you&#8217;re a quick one.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to the present wherein you probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>This fellow took a tremendous risk on me. At the time, I didn&#8217;t recognize how big a chance it was. The chance was that I had the team skills and the personality fit for the company and that the technical skills would come. Bless him for being able to recognize that and for placing such a high priority on them but my experience is that he&#8217;s the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>There have been a number of discussions on interview questions of late in blogs and discussion groups. I&#8217;ll single out <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001042.html" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood&#8217;s list</a> because&#8230;I dunno&#8230; it was probably the last blog I read on the topic. I don&#8217;t have a lot of pride so I don&#8217;t mind admitting I&#8217;d probably flunk his test. And I write code for a living. Worst-case insertion performance of a hashtable? No idea. How do you test if the high-order bit is set? My answer would probably be eleventeen. Even the one on reading integers from a text file I&#8217;d probably falter on if I didn&#8217;t have an IDE with IntelliSense.</p>
<p>On a side note, this is probably a dangerous line of thinking coming on the heels of Ray Lewallen questioning the <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2008/01/22/there-is-too-much-money-to-be-made-in-software-development.aspx" target="_blank">money being spent on mediocrity</a>. But in Ray&#8217;s post, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/" target="_blank">Dave Laribee</a> comments that the winning attitude and the winning skillz should be rewarded. I.E. Not <i>just</i> the talent and not <i>just</i> the attitude.</p>
<p>And even then, what&#8217;s the definition of &#8220;talent&#8221;? The ability to recite from a computer science manual? Or someone who knows how to transform business requirements into reasonably designed software and who can figure out the technical problems as they arise.<img src="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/WindowsLiveWriter/3b6831e7def1_124BD/gemd_02_img0090_3.jpg" style="border: 0px none" alt="gemd_02_img0090" align="right" border="0" height="161" width="244"></p>
<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d want someone that lies somewhere along that spectrum that makes sense to your organization. (Not to imply the two are mutually exclusive, either.) For a research position, business requirements may not be so ambiguous and you need someone who is acutely aware of how to unroll a for loop into assembly. For your average business application, maybe someone nearer the other end.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s not get all crazy and start assumin&#8217; I don&#8217;t care if you are capable of finding all the prime numbers between 1 and 4. You do need to have some base level of knowledge in whatever technology is required. Nor am I suggesting you break out a Rorschach test during the interview. But there needs to be at least some emphasis on the candidate&#8217;s personality. And maybe I&#8217;m overly optimistic/naive, but I have a feeling that if you gear your interview toward determining those less objective traits, you&#8217;ll be able to determine their level of expertise anyway.</p>
<p>By the way, if you&#8217;re looking for closure on the story, I stayed with them for a year, learned ASP, XSL, DHTML, and VB, then bolted to a consulting company. It sounds rather mercenary and when I think back on it, it was, even if I didn&#8217;t mean it to be. It was a good move for me career-wise but has always left a bad taste in my mouth. Damn conscience&#8230;</p>

I am a young developer, still getting my head round it all, with the constant worry that I am way behind the times. Im 23, working towards MCAD in C#. I have to use .NET 1.1, I want to be using 2.0, I want to be learning 3.0+ but I can&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>I have just landed a new job, funnily enough, working with ASP.NET, which I have never worked with.</p>
<p>They are taking a risk with me, I know they could have found someone else. I asked why they took me, they responded, &#8220;your attitude won it for you, we know you don&#8217;t have all the technical skills at the moment, but we know you will pick it all up quickly and have a great attitude to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite frankly (sorry if egotistical sounding), I agree. I don&#8217;t want to be a complete nerd that can recite every known algorithm to man both in alphabetical order as well as chronological from publication. I want to be damn good at what I do. I will throw myself to the wolves and bust my balls to get it right. I&#8217;ll also make sure I&#8217;ll have fun doing it. I like people (contrary to belief) THEY make computers work. I can punch code and make the computer do things, maybe not <technically> the best way, but it does what people want it to do, and I get code changes done as quickly as possible. Do I need to do more?</p>
<p>I would have also failed Jeff&#8217;s interview.. Yet I was offered my new job on the same day, and they wanted me in ASAP.</technically></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing software since 1967, and have done one of pretty much anything you can do on a pc including the BIOS. I&#8217;m productive 12 hours a day doing web database software in .NET and I have yet to see one of those silly assed lists that I could pass. Here&#8217;s a blog post about just that from December:</p>
<p><a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/WynApseTechnicalMusings/archive/2007/12/02/117297.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://geekswithblogs.net/WynApseTechnicalMusings/archive/2007/12/02/117297.aspx</a></p>
<p>I have a set of 8 questions of my own, all taken from live code. All 8 have obvious answers and all 8 answers are incorrect unless you&#8217;ve been elbow deep in win32 and MFC.</p>
<p>Next time I interview, that list goes with me, and after I fail to answer the questions they had on their hour exam last week, I&#8217;ll haul out my list.</p>
<p>What they don&#8217;t remember is interviewing is 2-way. They want to know if I&#8217;m as anal-retentive as they are, independent of my ability to be productive, and I want to know if I can picture myself working with these guys.</p>

Even after all the technically-based questions and tests you can pose on a candidate, in the end you have to make a Human judgement.  If you ignore your &#8220;gut feeling&#8221; you&#8217;ll likely be disappointed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve hired people who didn&#8217;t come across well because I felt then didn&#8217;t interview well (and some people don&#8217;t).  I haven&#8217;t been disappointed yet&#8230;  And it works both ways, I&#8217;ve chosen less technically qualified people over people who have aced interviews because of various &#8220;gut feelings&#8221;.  I purposely pick a few questions from the online pool of questions (like from Scott Hanselman&#8217;s list) and ask those.  If they&#8217;re really quick or really text-book with those and slower with the ones I &#8220;hand-craft&#8221; I know they&#8217;ve just memorized them.  That doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t hire them; it just means I&#8217;ll take that into account.  If all the other blow chunks, the one that memorizes is better than the ones that didn&#8217;t bother memorizing.</p>

<p>working as a team in close proximity makes attitude indispensable. who wants to work with a douche bag know-it-all? there should be a free exchange of ideas and when you leave your mind open to learning new stuff it&#8217;s amazing how well that works.</p>
<p>all that said, i think you do need a few people with top talent, but without people skill top talent is only maybe a quarter of the battle.</p>
<p>anyway, my thoughts/opinions on the matter, FWIW, IMHO, disclaim, disclaim&#8230;</p>

I had experiences in the past applying for ASP NET position where I was refused because I had a small flaw in my own implementation of C itoa function (converting between number systems without any help functions)<br />
I was really sad about it, but then after a while I have realized that if they treat candidates &#8220;as numbers&#8221; and not as people and give generic questions regardless of what you apply for, than they would probably treat me  as a number once I would start to work for them. </p>
<p>Life is to short for being a number <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
