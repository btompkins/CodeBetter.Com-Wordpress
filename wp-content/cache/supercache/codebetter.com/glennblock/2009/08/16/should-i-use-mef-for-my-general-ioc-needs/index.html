<p>This has been a question we hear again and again both internally and externally.&nbsp; MEF in V1 is targetting third-party extensibility scenarios, or open-systems which discover their components rather than having them explicitly configured. This is why our attributed model was crafted in the fashion that it was.&nbsp; Now that doesn&rsquo;t answer the question, &ldquo;Can I use MEF today for my general IoC needs?&rdquo;. Like all things in software, it depends <img src='http://codebetter.com/glennblock/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> , in this case on what your IoC needs are. </p>
<p><strong>Update: The list has been updated based on feedback from my team.</strong></p>
<p>On first glance, MEF may seem to be very similar to your favorite IoC container. However as they say, the devil is in the details. Here are a few details to consider which should help you in your decision and set proper expectations about using MEF:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&nbsp; need/want centralized configuration of plain old CLR objects (POCOs) then MEF is not the right choice.
<ul>
<li>We do have TypeCatalogs which allow you pick and choose which Types you have in the container, but those types <span style="text-decoration: underline">still have to attributed</span>, thus the configuration mechanism is configuring which attributed MEF parts show up. This is because our attributed model is really optimized around discovery of a set of unknown components vs configuring a pre-defined set. </li>
<li>As we don&#8217;t have a central configuration mechanism, we also have no explict way to pipe configuration settings like &#8220;Port&#8221; or &#8220;Uri&#8221; into a specific part.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you need AOP/Interception like injecting logging, or automatic transcation management then MEF doesn&rsquo;t include any native support for this. </li>
<li>Open generics support (register IRepository&lt;&gt; which can handle all IRepository&lt;T&gt; dependencies) is not baked in. </li>
<li>If you need custom lifetime support such as per-thread, per-session MEF includes only two lifetime models, shared and non-shared. To get more complex lifetimes requires manually setting up container hierarchies. It is doable, but requires work. </li>
<li>If you need paramterized construction, that is creating a part where specific imports are passed in at the time of construction, then this is also not supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>In enterprise applications with a large number of different types of components, the above list will probably be more significant. However, if none of the above are core concerns then MEF might be fine for your needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MEF does an excellent job of decoupling implementations and assembling component hierarchies, but it is tailored today for implicit composition and discovery.</p>
<p>In the next version of MEF that will ship post .NET 4.0,&nbsp; we are planning to focus more on explicit composition, and will be addressing many of the items on the above list. Until then, it is likely that there will be some great community implementations such as <a href="http://mefcontrib.codeplex.com">MEF Contrib</a> which will address many of these concerns, but these are not part of MEF itself.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characterestic about MEF vs IoC is MEF&#8217;s suitability and optimization toward third-party extensibility and discovery.</p>
<p>The point of this post is not to tell you to use MEF over Castle, Autofac, etc. Even if I wanted to say that (which I wouldn&#8217;t), Nick and Hamilton on my team would never let me get away with it <img src='http://codebetter.com/glennblock/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Instead the point is to set expectations on MEF&#8217;s usage for more general needs other than extensibility. In some applications it may be fine, in other&#8217;s it won&#8217;t be. I&#8217;ve given the list of some of the key driving factors to consider. For example if poco is at the top of your list, then you&#8217;ve already made your decision.</p>
<p>This is for those who are considering MEF&#8217;s usage for these cases. In general we have been very clear at not recommending to replace your  favorite IoC with MEF. If you are happy with using your favorite (mine these days is Autofac) then rock-on.</p>

For example, I&#8217;m trying to use MEF to locate plugins for a web application. If those plugins take an IFooRepository, then IFooRepository needs to have MEF attributes too so when the ImportingConstructor is called, MEF can auto-create the dependencies.</p>

<p>I was planning a follow up post on &#8220;Should I use MEF with another IoC container&#8221; which will cover this. Yes, this is a very valid concern if you are using both. There are several approaches on getting the two to work together such that you can mix and match components from each.</p>
<p>IoC containers can be enabled to talk to MEF catalogs where there is only one container present. Basically this means the container also understands how to read MEF&#8217;s attributes model, though it uses parts of MEF to do it. Nick Blumhardt has a post on how this is possible here: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nblumhardt/archive/2009/03/16/hosting-mef-extensions-in-an-ioc-container.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/nblumhardt/archive/2009/03/16/hosting-mef-extensions-in-an-ioc-container.aspx</a></p>
<p>The other pattern is to have two containers that are wired to talk to each other. Piotr has put together a Unity integration layer that takes advantage of extension points in both Unity and MEF to create a bridge between the two. In this model, MEF&#8217;s container is hidden behind the scenes but handles providing MEF components. You can read about that here: <a href="http://pwlodek.blogspot.com/2009/05/unity-mef-integration-layer.html" rel="nofollow">http://pwlodek.blogspot.com/2009/05/unity-mef-integration-layer.html</a></p>
<p>Look for more on this in the future.</p>
<p>Regards<br />

<p>By XAML, do you mean declaring MEF parts in XAML? Or having elements within XAML get composed with MEF imports, as I mentioned here: <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/glenn.block/archive/2009/07/18/mef-and-xaml-integration-self-composition.aspx?" rel="nofollow">http://codebetter.com/blogs/glenn.block/archive/2009/07/18/mef-and-xaml-integration-self-composition.aspx?</a></p>

Both have the goal to choose an implementation of your interfaces. The thing separating them is how you configure what implementation to pick. I use MEF as a IoC container on several websites and I have never had any problems with it.</p>
