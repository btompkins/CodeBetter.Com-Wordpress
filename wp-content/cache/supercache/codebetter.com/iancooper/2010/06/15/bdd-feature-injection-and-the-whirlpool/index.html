practice</a> to begin presenting on the techniques. <a href="http://lizkeogh.com/">Liz Keogh</a> came to my last<br />
presentation at London .Net Developers Group and suggested that I needed to<br />
look at <a href="http://www.limitedwipsociety.org/tag/feature-injection/">Feature<br />
Injection</a> as part of BDD practice now. Chris Matt&#8217;s comics are a good<br />
starting point for Feature Injection.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not tried Feature Injection, but think its definitely worth a look for<br />
anyone using BDD. I&#8217;m keen to get a better understanding of how it might modify<br />
our &#8216;today&#8217; practice. This is just really some early notes on what I know now.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholder Stories<br /></b></p>
<p>Liz Keogh has a useful article on how sees the overall process of BDD when<br />
using Feature Injection over at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/pulling-power">InfoQ</a>. The shift in<br />
how user stories are phrased seems to be one key to understanding this.<br />
Business Value is now being recognized as a key driver for why we are<br />
delivering a piece of work. So we re-phrase the classic Role-Goal-Motivation<br />
User Story as:</p>
<p>As a &lt;role&gt;</p>
<p>I want to &lt;goal&gt;</p>
<p>So that &lt;motivation&gt;</p>
<p>with </p>
<p>In order to &lt;achieve some outcome which<br />
contributes to the vision&gt;<br />
As a &lt;stakeholder&gt;<br />
I want &lt;some other stakeholder&gt; &lt;to do, use or be restricted by<br />
something&gt;</p>
<p>Liz calls these <i>stakeholder stories</i> to emphasize the difference from user stories.</p>
<p><b>Distilling the Vision</b></p>
<p>Notice how the outcome, the reference to the vision, why are we building<br />
this software now comes first over the goal. We emphasize that it is not enough<br />
to say what, but also to say why. How does this story help us meet the vision?<br />
When I talk about BDD I often shorthand it as &#8220;Build the right<br />
software&#8221; in comparison to TDD which helps us &#8220;Build the software<br />
right&#8221;. Feature Injection seems to take this process one step further by<br />
saying that it is not enough to restrict the developers to only building<br />
software that satisfies a specification, but also to ensure that those<br />
specifications are authored only for those stories that deliver on the vision.<br />
So where does the vision come from? In DDD terms the Vision results from the Distillation<br />
process. Identify the core domain and produce a Core Domain Vision statement.<br />
So the technique of Feature Injection reinforces DDD&#8217;s Distillation technique.<br />
Both Liz&#8217;s article and Chris Matt&#8217;s comics identify some standard techniques<br />
for helping to distil what is core domain from what is not. Given that vision<br />
the stakeholders then work to identify the broad features of what need to be<br />
delivered. User stories come from decomposing these features. </p>
<p>Our software lifecycle tends to begin with Iteration -1 in which the Big<br />
Plan, how we think we might build some software to satisfy a Vision is taken to<br />
sponsors. At that point we have only the results of Distillation (what DDD<br />
calls a Distillation document) and enough understanding of the Feature Set we<br />
need to provide a rough costing (folks want to know the order of the costs to<br />
understand whether the business value justifies the cost &#8211; software is an<br />
economic proposition). We then move to Iteration 0 or project Chartering, where<br />
we might capture initial stories and produce what Crystal calls an <a href="http://iancooper.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!844BD2811F9ABE9C!527.entry">Exploratory<br />
360</a>.</p>
<p>What I like most about Feature Injection at first reading&nbsp; is this<br />
explicitness with which it highlights what happens in Iteration -1 and<br />
Iteration 0. These are no longer &#8216;locked in the attic&#8217; in agile process terms,<br />
but brought to the fore as a vital part of the methodology. I have come across<br />
too many teams that have no idea about Iteration -1 or Iteration 0, push<br />
straight into Iteration 1 and build the wrong thing. So any process that<br />
highlights the need for this to occur gets a thumbs up from me.</p>
<p><b>What is Business Value</b>?</p>
<p>If we are suggesting that our focus is on business value, how do we assess<br />
value? Chris Matt&#8217;s admonition to focus on delivering business value over<br />
features is something about Feature Injection that I really warm to, as again<br />
and again we try to point to the fact that the most important metric for us is<br />
business value. In particular Feature Injection suggests &#8216;popping the why<br />
stack&#8217; until you can arrive at a definition of business value that meets Andy<br />
Poll&#8217;s advice that &#8216;A project creates business value when it increases or<br />
protects revenue, or reduces costs in alignment with the strategy of the<br />
organization&#8217;. That&#8217;s pith because it not only identifies revenue or cost as<br />
the driver, but alignment with business strategy. For Chris, the place to look<br />
for business value is in the outputs of the system. It is the outputs that you<br />
can measure for business value. So once we identify an output, we &#8216;pop the<br />
stack&#8217; to find its business value.</p>
<p><b>Whither Use Cases?</b></p>
<p>Of late I have been wondering about the correspondence between examples and<br />
use cases and questioning whether as we emphasize modelling from examples that<br />
use cases did not have it right all along. So it is interesting in Liz&#8217;s<br />
article to pick up on the same question from Eric Evans, and respond that<br />
&#8220;You can&#8217;t ask a business person for a use case unless they&#8217;re already<br />
technical enough to know what a use case is. But you can ask them for an<br />
example&#8221;. That implies that they are two different approaches to the same<br />
goal, but the user is placed in the driving seat with examples. It&#8217;s a good<br />
explanation of the difference.</p>
<p><b>Intersection with DDD</b></p>
<p>Interestingly enough at Domain Driven Design Exchange, Gojko Adzic presented<br />
on the intersection of BDD and DDD and feature injection was at the heart of<br />
how he saw the two corresponding. You can see Gojko&#8217;s presentation <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/ddd-tdd-bdd">here</a>.<br />
Gojko&#8217;s main assertion, as I understand it, is that having used <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/104">Distillation</a> (figuring<br />
out what is <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/99">Core Domain</a> where you<br />
expend modelling effort, as opposed a Supporting Domain, where you don&#8217;t) to<br />
decide what to build we hold <a href="http://www.acceptancetesting.info/key-ideas/specification-workshop/">Specification<br />
Workshop</a> to drive out the scope using Feature Injection. We then model<br />
using to the scenarios outlined for the stories to create a <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/132">Ubiquitous Language</a>. At<br />
the same time Eric Evans spoke about his perspective on Agile and DDD, looking<br />
at DDD&#8217;s need to produce a Ubiquitous Language and asking if that was in<br />
conflict with Agile preference for &#8220;Last Responsible Moment&#8221; over<br />
BDUF. Again the solution space seemed to me to focus on modelling from<br />
examples, with enough modelling up front, followed by further modelling as the<br />
model is stressed. You can see Eric&#8217;s talk <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/folding-together-ddd-agile">here</a>,<br />
which includes a prototypical discussion of his Whirlpool approach.</p>
<p><b>Is there too much focus on the UI here though?</b></p>
<p>One of my concerns about the process as written is some of the focus on UI.<br />
I understand the principle that the user consumes through the UI and it is<br />
therefore the only valid test of the system, but this overlooks the extent to<br />
which the UI is in flux during the early part of development. Indeed the<br />
approach identifies that we need to release early to get feedback on the UI and<br />
revise. Those revisions cause issues for tests that are focused on the UI,<br />
because as the UI changes, the tests break. Rick Mugridge in <i>Fit for<br />
Developing Software</i> is to test the business rules, not the workflow.
 </p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t want folks to get the wrong impression here. We product a Balsamiq mockup of our user interface as part of the discussion on any story, often as part of our describe step, and we iterate over it. So I am certainly not saying that the UI is not vital to successful delivery to the customer or to understanding what is to be delivered. However I am more cautious around automate testing that focuses on the UI as the driver for development. I would rather drive from the rules than a UI focused test. We still have story tests to help &#8216;build the right thing&#8217;, in Fitnesse (replace with Cucumber, Fit, Slim, Specflow, StoryTeller etc) but they are<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Layer%20Test.html"> subcutaneous tests</a>. Much of our UI testing is via Exploratory Testing, and automated UI suites check only stable areas and act as smoke tests for regression issues.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>All in all, very interesting stuff, that I will be looking into more as I try to refine my BDD practice</p>
