</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Action Plan for ALT.NET</h4>
<p>The first ALT.NET conference is in the books and it&#8217;s time to start thinking about the next one.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t give you any concrete announcements because I flat out don&#8217;t know, but this is what I&#8217;m seeing or hearing:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the complaints or suggestions from Austin was to get an&nbsp;online repository going&nbsp;just to&nbsp;make it easy to find content.&nbsp; There&#8217;s&nbsp;been a tremendous amount of content generated on our blogs alone over the last couple years, but there&#8217;s no way a new user could easily find the nuggets buried&nbsp;underneath the rants.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m proposing, and may just do myself, a small link library akin to the <a href="http://www.agilealliance.org/library">old articles repository</a> at the <a href="http://agilealliance.com">Agile Alliance website</a>.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>Seattle is the city I&#8217;m hearing most for the&nbsp;sequel event, followed by Austin again in the fall.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing stopping you from doing <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/10/11/when-will-you-plan-an-altnetconf.aspx">another one yourself</a>.
</li>
<li>I think it would be relatively simple to&nbsp;do a low key event in the&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;area.&nbsp; Enough of us are here to do it, and Microsoft has volunteered their facility to host it in the past.&nbsp; I think the Open Spaces format makes this kind of event relatively easy to pull off.
</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a Yahoo group going at&nbsp;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/" title="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/</a> that&#8217;s generating quite a bit of traffic at the moment.&nbsp; It&#8217;s&nbsp;wide open to anyone who wants to join and might already&nbsp;be your best bet for .Net centric discussions of BDD, DSL&#8217;s, and DDD.
</li>
<li>Spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out a different name.&nbsp; The current name is divisive and contentious.&nbsp; The other&nbsp;proposed names are pretentious.&nbsp; Google and Technorati are already indexed on ALT.NET.&nbsp; I expect no movement on that front.&nbsp; Hopefully that dies down and we can get on with defining what we&#8217;re about and it turns into just a random collection of letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Testing through the User Interface</h4>
<p>I had a couple conversations and&nbsp;a couple email queries about automated testing through the user interface itself.&nbsp; I&#8217;m mostly speaking here about testing WinForms clients because that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve done in the past year.&nbsp; Let me run through this subject in bullet point form:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ve got two basic options for testing the user interface.&nbsp; You can either slice the view itself as thin as possible and then use subcutaneous testing to work over the screen behavior from the Controller/Presenter level down.&nbsp; The other option is to use some kind of tool that can interact with the user interface itself.&nbsp; Testing web applications is far easier&nbsp; because of the plethora of testing tools.&nbsp; With WinForms, I simply start up the Form I want and interact with it directly or with <a href="http://nunitforms.sourceforge.net">NUnitForms</a>.&nbsp; My experience is that subcutaneous testing works great with reporting applications, but data entry screens or screens with a lot more behavior need to be tested through the screen itself.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s all about the design.</strong>&nbsp; Actually that pretty well goes for large scale automated testing of basically any piece of code.&nbsp; Even when I&#8217;m testing through the screen, I try to open up only that one screen without the rest of the application hanging around.&nbsp; Each screen is roughly an MVP triad plus whatever service providers that the presenter needs to communicate with.&nbsp; All&nbsp;dependencies from the Presenter back to the rest of the application are expressed as abstracted interfaces, so I&#8217;ve got an automatic testing seam.&nbsp; When I&#8217;m testing strictly screen behavior I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net">StructureMap</a> to set up the individual screen I want to test with stubs in place for the services, repositories, and application controllers that make up the rest of the application.&nbsp; That strategy allows me to quickly set up screen scenarios inside the tests and keep the tests from getting bogged down in manipulating widgets just to get to the screen I care about.</li>
<li>Smaller tests are far simpler than bigger tests.&nbsp; Whitebox testing is far more efficient in terms of effort to reward than blackbox testing.</li>
<li>Should you test against the user interface at all?&nbsp; There&#8217;s a line of argument that says the acceptance tests should test against the actual&nbsp;domain model only.&nbsp; After giving this some though, I don&#8217;t think this is pragmatic.&nbsp; Practically speaking, the average non-technical person understands the stuff that they can observe on the screens better than any domain model.&nbsp; In my previous two projects&nbsp;we had a lot of screen behavior that frankly makes the difference between an adequate user experience and an application that&#8217;s likeable.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of event driven&nbsp;screen behavior that can spawn bugs and regression failures like no other type of code.&nbsp; Once the behavior gets complex,&nbsp;only unit testing the Presenter&#8217;s just doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore.&nbsp; I write acceptance tests for my TradeCapture applications for each trade ticket screen and it&#8217;s done wonders to tamp down on regression problems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m reopening &#8220;Build your own CAB&#8221; just to hit this subject a little better and actually explain how I&#8217;m testing my user interface.&nbsp; I&#8217;m starting up the content on testable UI&#8217;s as soon as I publish this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>You have to make the argument in terms of economics</h4>
<p>There was a lot of moaning, both at the conference and on blogs later that management just won&#8217;t go for this stuff.&nbsp; You just can&#8217;t say &#8220;it&#8217;ll make the code easier to read and more maintainable&#8221; to management and expect them to do anything.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to connect your arguments to economics.&nbsp; Doing this will lower the cost of ownership.&nbsp; Doing this will make it easier to test and therefore to finish.&nbsp; Doing this will keep the expensive rewrite away for longer.&nbsp; Enhancements will be cheaper.&nbsp; If there isn&#8217;t an economic impact in your favor you don&#8217;t have an argument anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Too Many Bulls in the Pen</h4>
<p>Can more than one strong&nbsp;developer coexist in a small project?&nbsp; Can two or more strong personalities coexist?&nbsp; I say yes because I&#8217;ve done it.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve just got to be prepared to compromise.&nbsp; A little bit of mutual respect doesn&#8217;t hurt either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Language Oriented Programming</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s veering off in many forms, but there was one very apparent trend in the topics of discussion and interest at ALT.NET.&nbsp; We&#8217;re all trying to express or specify the behavior of the code in the language of the domain problem itself.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the never ending climb up levels of abstractions.&nbsp; I think of it all as just trying to hide the ugly machinery behind the right abstractions to focus more on the problem instead of the mechanics.&nbsp; Domain Driven Design is pushing us to think in terms of the problem domain instead of data structures and coding goo.&nbsp; Behavior Driven Development is a positive evolution of TDD.&nbsp; Nobody quite seems to agree on what BDD is or how it should be done, but I like the content and thought in <a href="http://adams.id.au/blog/2007/10/what-is-behaviour-driven-development/">this paper on BDD from Tom Adams</a>.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about Domain Specific Languages in all of their forms.&nbsp; I&#8217;m leery of trying out external languages with something like ANTLR myself, but you can write that one off as cowardice.&nbsp; I had a good discussion about the viability of graphical DSL&#8217;s, but I&#8217;m still dubious about the general applicability of these.&nbsp; My main interest is in embedded or internal DSL&#8217;s.&nbsp; Everybody is waiting for IronRuby to get its expressiveness, but Boo might be the thing to use today.&nbsp; I desperately wanted to fall in love with NBehave, but the syntax in C# 2.0 is just too verbose.&nbsp; Language Oriented Programming just isn&#8217;t going to take off in widespread usage until we change languages.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that there is still some real value in selectively&nbsp;using Fluent Interfaces in C# 2.0.&nbsp; <a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/">Jimmy Bogard</a> has some more to say in that regard in <a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/10/fluent-interface-endgame.html">Fluent Interface endgame</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why ScottGu and Co are doing it&nbsp;right with the&nbsp;Model View Controller Thing</h4>
<p>We only saw an hour introduction, and there&#8217;s a lot of unanswered questions and missing details, but what I saw of the new MVC web framework was more than enough to start salivating.&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
<li>ScottGu had me at &#8220;Separation of Concerns&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk started with a slide on the design values and goals of the MVC framework.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t remember the exact wording, but it included all the magic words like &#8220;Separation of Concerns&#8221; and &#8220;Testability.&#8221;&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t just the slide either because these things came up over and over again.&nbsp; I honestly think they&#8217;ve done the right things here.</li>
<li>As I stated in an earlier post, they&#8217;re obviously seeking out lessons from other MVC frameworks like MonoRail</li>
<li>The HTTP runtime objects are, drum roll please, mockable/stub-able.&nbsp; Amen.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easily extensible.&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of activity to build specific &#8220;opinionated&#8221; frameworks right on top of it.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t a drop in replacement for Ruby on Rails or MonoRail.&nbsp; I think the apples to apples comparison is with just ActionPack from Rails.&nbsp; That leaves a lot of other things like scaffolding alternatives and deployment recipes ala Capistrano yet to come.</li>
<li>The view rendering engines are swappable</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll be able to use the IoC tool of your choice.&nbsp; Not a make or break reason, but hearing ScottGu say &#8220;Windsor or Spring or StructureMap&#8221; out loud&nbsp;was nice.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Executable Requirements</h4>
<p>Much more on this in a &nbsp;later post.&nbsp; I still think this is one of the last pieces of outstanding business in Agile development.&nbsp; There&#8217;s so much advantage, but the challenges always seem in surmountable.&nbsp; While introducing this topic in my session, I compared Executable Requirements to the oil sands in Canada.&nbsp; This giant source of oil we just can&#8217;t seem to get to economically.&nbsp; I was promptly corrected by the Albertans in the room that the oil sands are now producing, so maybe there&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Verdict on the Open Spaces Format</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Spaces format</a> rocks.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been said elsewhere, but I&#8217;ll repeat it here.&nbsp; The best part of&nbsp;every technical conference I&#8217;ve ever been to happened in the hallway conversations and in the interactions with the people that you meet.&nbsp; On the other hand, the talks themselves are usually just so so in terms of holding my attention.&nbsp; With the Open Spaces format you basically skip the boring parts and get right to the interaction.&nbsp; The self organizing nature of the format led to sessions where the participants were fully engaged.&nbsp; Interaction, conversations, and even arguments are more fulfilling to me than watching slidedecks go by.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t wait to do the next event along these lines.</p>
<p>I do think the format only worked because we made it work.&nbsp; You have to come ready to stand up and actively participate.&nbsp; You only get out of it what the group as a whole puts into it.</p>
<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Microsoft isn&#8217;t the answer to everything</h4>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find any trace of it on the web, but I remember learning a fable in school about a king whose subjects depended upon him for everything.&nbsp; One day the exasperated king ordered his guards to dig a hole in one of the main thoroughfares leading to town.&nbsp; Into this hole was placed a bag of gold and a large rock was set on top of the hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody passing down the road couldn&#8217;t help&nbsp;but notice the rock blocking the way.&nbsp; Various passersby saw the rock in the middle of the road and promptly went to Microsoft, er, the king, to ask him to remove the rock from the road.&nbsp; The king despaired until a young man walking down the road finally thought to roll the rock off the road so wagons could run unimpeded.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t remember what happens next, but I assume that the young man lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another debate going on in the altnetconf group.&nbsp; Should ALT.NET try to work from within the existing .Net community structures like INETA or .Net user groups, or skip that and do our own thing?&nbsp; I frankly don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; On one hand you reach more people by staying in the mainstream.&nbsp; On the other hand we might not be able to make things happen within INETA or the existing user groups.&nbsp; The one thing I don&#8217;t want to happen is get bogged down waiting for Microsoft to make everything better for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Microsoft&#8217;s Agile Portal</h4>
<p>Did you know that MSDN has a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb404166.aspx">web portal dedicated to Agile development</a>?&nbsp; Neither did I.&nbsp; Or all of the non-Microsoft employees in the room when they told us about it.&nbsp; I took a look tonight and there&#8217;s plenty there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s in an odd place, but it <strong>is</strong> there.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-2842" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;d like to echo that tip on speaking in economic terms.  Managers don&#8217;t care about agile practices unless it will make *them* look better.  The person paying the bills doesn&#8217;t care unless it saves him money.  Speak in these terms and you&#8217;ll have more success.  But it&#8217;s important to actually tie these claims to actual numbers.  They don&#8217;t have to be exact, but gather some data from past projects and come up with a formula that will tell them HOW MUCH money they will save.</p>
<p>Saying &#8220;it will make our code more maintainable&#8221; is a loose statement that won&#8217;t get you anywhere.  Get some data behind you and make a claim like &#8220;My estimates show that our maintenance costs will be reduced by 40%, saving us $250k per year&#8221;  &#8211;this will perk the attention of managers.</p>

<p>Just be careful with you assertions. I know you have the best intentions on delivering cost savings but you may incur impediments along the way from a bureaucratic perspective that will prevent you from reaching your goal.  The problem lies in that management will impose these impediments but will still hold you accountable on delivering your 40% cost savings.</p>

I think it conveys that the movement is about moving forward, helping the .NET community to &#8220;come of age&#8221; and embrace mature development practices.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s divisive.  Pretentious?  Maybe.  But just about anything we come up with that adequately reflects our goals will sound pretentious to some people.  Just my two cents.
