<P>I think the general model of one or few architects or technical leads&nbsp;designing to many developers just coding is a flawed model.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a tenuous boundary between coding, design, and architecture.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a mistake to overlook the impact of one upon the other.&nbsp; The quality of a system&#8217;s code is largely the sum of a lot of small decisions more than the first couple big architectural decisions.&nbsp; In order to get these small decisions (where&nbsp;should <STRONG>this</STRONG> code go?) right we need to put skill at designing software right at the point of attack &#8212; the developer&#8217;s keyboard.&nbsp; Having all of the design knowledge embodied in a handful of architects is like putting hundred pound weaklings on your offensive line while the three hundred-pounders coach from the sideline.</P><br />
<P>A software design generally doesn&#8217;t spring forth like Athena jumping out fully formed from Zeus&#8217;s forehead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a devotee of the Extreme Programming creed.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t build architectures and designs, we grow them over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful&nbsp;continuous designs aren&#8217;t&nbsp;willy nilly code n&#8217;fix either.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous design efforts&nbsp;require constant attention to weed out bad code, remove the rough edges around designs, eliminate duplication wherever it&#8217;s found, and always look for better abstractions.&nbsp; This organic approach to design can only work if the people doing the coding are skilled in software design enough to recognize problems and opportunities for improvement in the design.&nbsp; </P><br />
<P>There&#8217;s a saying attributed to open source software that goes &#8220;with enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow.&#8221;&nbsp; One of the reasons that I don&#8217;t believe in the &#8220;one architect, many coders&#8221; model is the dampening of the feedback loop.&nbsp; If I&#8217;m doing all or most of the design and little of the actual coding I&#8217;m not getting much direct feedback about my design.&nbsp; I&#8217;m effectively flying by instruments and intuition alone.&nbsp; It&#8217;s better for me as a designer of software if I have to feel the &#8220;pain&#8221; from the design decisions I make.&nbsp; The final arbiter of design quality is often coding that design.&nbsp; Many things that seem perfectly valid on a whiteboard or in UML diagrams break down when you hit the actual code because of something you didn&#8217;t consider, or a better idea rears its head.&nbsp; You need to be able to get that feedback and adjust to arrive at a better design.&nbsp; Since no one person can code all of a big system by himself, every other&nbsp;developer needs to be a pair of eyes and ears into the design to gather more feedback.&nbsp; Every developer might not be able to contribute to the formulation of the design, but they should at least be able to spot things like&nbsp;duplication, violations of encapsulation, and unnecessary complexity.&nbsp; Give every developer some modicum of design knowledge, put their eyeballs onto the code, and make many of your design problems shallow problems.</P><br />
<P>I&#8217;ve said several times on this blog that the hardest and most critical part of creating a software design and architecture isn&#8217;t the actual creation, but rather the socialization of that design throughout the team.&nbsp; The perfect design isn&#8217;t helpful if the team doesn&#8217;t understand it enough to implement it (which pretty well eliminates the &#8220;perfect&#8221; from that sentence).&nbsp; On the other hand, if the team as a whole understands the &#8220;why&#8221; behind the design choices, they&#8217;re much more likely to carry out that design well.&nbsp; My experience says that this socialization happens more effectively&nbsp;when there&#8217;s a lot of discussion within the team both early in the project and throughout the project.&nbsp; Some leadership is still required to start the conversations and keep the conversations from stilting as the team can go head&#8217;s down under pressure schedule.&nbsp; Having a design determined by one or a few persons then dictated to the team never seems to work as well for socialization.&nbsp; Obviously, the flatter, collaborative model of growing a design is only going to be as good as the design skills of the team as a whole &#8212; yet one more reason to spread design skills downward.</P><br />
<P>Socializing the design and spreading design skill into the team at large&nbsp;should give the team&nbsp;a much better chance of knowing when to opt out of the general architecture when exception cases arise.&nbsp; Some of the worst designs I&#8217;ve seen have been caused by an unbending devotion to a design that didn&#8217;t make sense in its current context.&nbsp; For example, one of the two systems I&#8217;m working on uses a Supervising Controller architecture for most of the main screens, but we&#8217;ve found it useful to ditch that pattern for some one off screens.&nbsp; I want the developers on my team (all two of us, but you get the point) to know when it&#8217;s better to deviate from our standard screen structure.</P><br />
<P>&nbsp;</P><br />
<H4>What about the Architect?</H4><br />
<P>I wanted to leave the neverending debate over the&nbsp;duties or even existence of an architect role out of this post, but it&#8217;s basically impossible.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been mostly hostile to the idea of a dedicated architect in the past because of several bad experiences&nbsp;(and close to disdainful of most of the people calling themselves an &#8220;architect&#8221; in the .Net world), but I have the utmost respect for architecture and design&nbsp;skill.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been on projects where I thought it was highly advantageous to have a dedicated architect, but those projects involved integration across multiple systems and teams.&nbsp; In the end, I think my viewpoint is that &#8220;strength at the point of attack&#8221; is more important than the architect role.&nbsp; If the architect role actually detracts from this, then you simply can&#8217;t afford to make someone an architect.</P><br />
<P>Removing your most talented developers and most skilled software designers from the day to day coding work and low level design&nbsp;usually isn&#8217;t the right way to go.&nbsp; I think sometimes the architect role effectively pulls your strongest people off into a role where they have less impact on the quality of the design.&nbsp; My experience is that I&#8217;ve had much more positive impact on projects when I&#8217;m completely inside the development team than the projects where I was strictly an architect.&nbsp; If you have somebody with great design skills and a team that&#8217;s otherwise without design skill, I&#8217;d much rather that the person with the skills be put into a role where they can coach the other developers to spread out that knowledge.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t like divorcing the design skill, knowledge, and experience from the team building the software.&nbsp; I&#8217;d rather have those qualities applied at the point of attack.</P><br />
<P>I know where the pushback to the previous paragraph is going to come from.&nbsp; The average bigger shop doesn&#8217;t have enough architect caliber guys to go around, so they try to keep the architects out of the muck and strictly focused on design and architecture.&nbsp; Even worse is when a shop try&#8217;s to share architects over multiple projects at any one time, watering down the potential contributions of their architect folks.&nbsp; I think these shops need to be cognizant of the compromise that they&#8217;re making.&nbsp; They simply&nbsp;don&#8217;t have enough talent to go around for the project work on their plate.&nbsp; Since I don&#8217;t think the end results can be anything but mediocre without strength at the point of attack, I&#8217;d much rather cut down on the number of projects, and put the detached architects in a position to do as much coaching as possible to grow the people you already have.&nbsp; In formulating the tradeoffs of having a dedicated architect, I think we need to factor in the potential for making every other developer better.&nbsp; In the short term it might be more efficient to have the architect making all of the decisions, but in the long run it&#8217;s better to teach the other developers how to make decisions themselves.</P><br />
<P>&nbsp;</P><br />
<H4>ALT.NET</H4><br />
<P>What I&#8217;m aiming for here is no less than the full democratization of design skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;Design skill shouldn&#8217;t be the strict purview of any kind of elite that remains aloof from the rest of the project teams.&nbsp; Chip Lemmon <A href="http://geekswithblogs.net/clemmon/archive/2007/10/02/115774.aspx">expressed some concern</A> that the ALT.NET event this weekend could lead to some runaway elitism that wouldn&#8217;t do a thing for the average developer.&nbsp; Possibly, but one of the topics I want to discuss is what, if anything, can we do to start raising the general level of design knowledge throughout the larger developer population.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the best way to coach other developers?&nbsp; How do we make the skills and tools we&#8217;re de facto espousing under the ALT.NET banner common enough to make them viable in the community at large?&nbsp; All these questions are going to come up.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll blog the proceedings&#8230;</P></p>

<p>2 points.  </p>
<p>1. you are dead on!  I tried a couple of years ago to start a movement  called &#8220;Entry Level Enterprise Development&#8221;.  The thought was to elevate and not innondate folks that weren&#8217;t following Enterprise practices.  It was slow going and I kind of let it die.  I&#8217;ll be the first to lend a hand if something like this comes out of ALT.Net.</p>
<p>2. It is Chip Lemmon, not Chris <img src='http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />   blame and credit need to go to the right place you know.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you are going to do the right thing at ALT.Net.  Awesome!</p>

I&#8217;m in an &#8220;architect&#8221; role with a team of smart devs, but none of them have any .NET experience. My plan is to put together the application up to a demonstrable point, but to have weekly or twice-weekly meetings to discuss my decisions and gather their input. Hopefully this will be enough to keep everyone in the loop and stop me from making naive decisions.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t disagree with you.  But talking about &#8216;Building a CAB in 15 minutes&#8217; or separation of concerns isn&#8217;t going to change senior management values (not to pick on you, but since you&#8217;ll obviously get the reference).  Is there anything at the Alt.NET event that is going to specifically address how to do this?  Out of curiosity, are there any non-Developer/Architects attending?</p>
<p>I think Agile in general does a pretty mediocre job of marketing itself (in some cases, it&#8217;s practically harmful).</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-2765" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree.  The best software work I&#8217;ve been involved with has been at the ground level, working closely with developers and architects alike.  And when that close collaboration occurs, there isn&#8217;t any difference between the developers and architects, just levels of experience and skill.  </p>
<p>Is there anything more &#8220;waterfallish&#8221; than a disconnected architect working from a mountain top?</p>

<p>What you describe, we used to call a &#8220;drive by architecture&#8221; in a previous job.  I thought you were making a Jonathon Livingston Seagull reference.  Now I&#8217;ve got Neil Diamond songs stuck in my mind.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-2768" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Jeremy, you&#8217;re like my evil twin that writes really well and has a lot of time to blog.  I agree with this post 100%.  Every &#8220;architect&#8221; I&#8217;ve encountered over the last couple of years has been completly out of the loop and spread too thinly.  The worse ones aren&#8217;t the least bit invested in your project, they just throw out a few rules that aren&#8217;t relevant half the time and move on to the next project.  Architects always seem to fade away whenever there are problems on a project, especially when they are caused by their suggestions.  My buddies and I always joke about guys/gals that have been architects for a couple of years because they become totally worthless and out of touch.  We&#8217;ve resisted the &#8220;architect&#8221; moniker for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work!!!</p>

<p>I know my personal matriculation into TDD/Better-OO-desgin will be fraught with challenges and discouragments but I nonetheless see it as key to exapnding my utility to the stakeholders I serve and the contemporaries with whom I comport. </p>
<p>Should there be room this weekend for the role (easy to play for me) I would like to play the devil&#8217;s-advocate or rather the dummies-advocate for ALT.Net practices. I self apply the term without shame becuase I beleive it is key for people approaching this journey to loose the preconception that admitting they have room to grow weakens their standing as a &#8220;developer&#8221;. I personally beleive there are a multitude of  &#8220;dumb&#8221; questions that go unanswered simply becuase folks working as developers for several years are afraid to admit their lack of insight into some of the more advanced OO concepts. </p>
<p>Time to get busy.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the weekend.</p>
