Dr.THULANI MOLLOY.<br />
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY,<br />
PRETORIA,<br />
SOUTH AFRICA.(mr.thulanimolloy@yahoo.it)</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. A member of the South gave your information to me African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because  of the nature of this business. </p>
<p>Within the Department of Minerals &#038; Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$16.500, 000.00 (Sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. </p>
<p>Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationship with foreign governments and non-government agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB). We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. </p>
<p>Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your Company. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation Will be  (25%), while my colleagues and I receive(65%) and the balance of (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses incurred. </p>
<p>The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with Utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour  of you/your Company. Also, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.your urgent response at (mr.thulanimolloy@yahoo.it )</p>
<p>Thanks for your co-operation.<br />
Regards,<br />
Dr.THULANI MOLLOY.<br />
