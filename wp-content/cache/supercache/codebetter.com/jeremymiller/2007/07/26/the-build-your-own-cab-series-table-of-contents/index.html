<p>I&#8217;m still working on the series, so check back here occasionally for updates and new downloads.&nbsp; After I finish posting the menu state series I&#8217;m going to take a break for a while, but it&#8217;s for a good cause.&nbsp; The most persistent complaint throughout the series is that it&#8217;s not clear how all the pieces fit together.&nbsp; Understandable.&nbsp; At the same time that I&#8217;m writing this series I&#8217;m also working on my OSS <a href="http://storyteller.tigris.org">StoryTeller</a> tool that includes a sizable WinForms client.&nbsp; Last week I scrapped about half of the StoryTeller UI code so I could go back and incorporate the ideas that I&#8217;ve explored through &#8220;Build a CAB.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say without a doubt that I&#8217;m the one person who&#8217;s learned the most from &#8220;Build a CAB.&#8221;&nbsp; What I&#8217;m hoping to do is use the StoryTeller UI code to demonstrate fully working screens from end to end.&nbsp; The beauty of using OSS code for examples is that the code is automatically available for download.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll finish before the end of the summer, I promise.&nbsp; Just set a bookmark to this page and I&#8217;ll keep updating it as the series expands.&nbsp; At the end I&#8217;ve committed to gathering all this stuff up into a single, printable PDF for download.<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="" title="intro" name="intro"></a><br />
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In building enterprise software systems I&#8217;ve often observed a feeling that building the actual User Interface is less demanding or important in terms of design compared to the backend.&nbsp; We worry quite a&nbsp;bit about the appearance and the usability of the User Interface, but how about the code structure of the UI&nbsp;itself?&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience,&nbsp;UI behavior changes more often than&nbsp;anything else and generates a&nbsp;much higher defect rate.&nbsp; Several years ago I&nbsp;briefly used&nbsp;Use Case Points as an estimation technique.&nbsp; One of the features of this technique that caught my eye at the time&nbsp;was how it treated user interface features.&nbsp; Any feature that included an interactive user interface was automatically given a higher modifier of effort than the same size feature that only dealt with other computers.&nbsp; In that technique it was a given that interfacing with a human was more complex than interfacing with&nbsp;other code.&nbsp; My point being here that user interface development is complex and we need to take it seriously.</p>
<p>A couple years ago heavy clients were out of style due to&nbsp;well-founded&nbsp;concerns over deployment and support issues.&nbsp; Lately, or at least for me anyway, heavy clients seem to have made a comeback as the newer .Net technologies have alleviated the deployment concerns somewhat.&nbsp; Instead of dying away, we&#8217;re building more complex WinForms user interfaces than ever before.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot of talk about building &#8220;composite&#8221; applications that can quickly host multiple, logical applications or applets in the same application&nbsp;shell.&nbsp; We&#8217;re trying to build applications that can be easily extended without ripping up the existing code.&nbsp; We&#8217;re sold on Test Driven Development, but the user interface has remained one of the last uncharted territories for automated testing.&nbsp; The traditional approach towards building user interfaces&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Microsoft is to fire up the designer and pump energy and effort into it until it works.&nbsp; That has to change.</p>
<p>At DevTeach 2007 I gave a talk called &#8220;Put Down that Wizard!&#8221; with a subtitle &#8220;Design Patterns for Maintainable WinForms.&#8221;&nbsp; By and large, the talk was about&nbsp;how to <b>code and design</b>&nbsp;a WinForms application.&nbsp; I discussed&nbsp;design patterns for assigning screen responsibilities, screen synchronization, and issues that effect testability of&nbsp;user interface code.&nbsp; I was fairly happy with the way the talk went and the feedback overall, but a particular comment from an attendee caught my eye:&nbsp; &#8220;the content was obscure.&#8221;&nbsp; The criticism itself wasn&#8217;t bothersome in and of itself, but the fact that these patterns were considered &#8220;obscure&#8221; definitely bothered me.&nbsp; Designing software is largely an exercise in determining the responsibilities of the code and assigning these same responsibilities to different modules of the code.&nbsp; How you assign, or fail to assign, responsibilities has a great impact on the maintainability of a codebase.&nbsp; Patterns like Model View Presenter are a reoccurring recipe for assigning responsibilities in a user interface.&nbsp; These patterns weren&#8217;t created or invented, they were&nbsp;discovered by practitioners who began to describe the structures that worked (or didn&#8217;t work).&nbsp; If we&#8217;re going to build <b>and evolve</b>&nbsp;more complex user interfaces, we can&#8217;t blow off the internal structure of the user interface code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a class="" title="what" name="what"></a>What&#8217;s this series about anyway?</h4>
<p>At DevTeach 2007 I was part of a panel on the tenuous relationship between Microsoft and the Open Source community.&nbsp; At some point in the panel discussion and the resulting&nbsp;blog discussions afterward, we set off an argument about whether or not the Composite Application Block (CAB) framework&nbsp;was necessary or even valuable for building larger, maintainable WinForms applications.&nbsp; My point of view then, and now, is that understanding the core concepts and patterns is the first step.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think you can use the CAB effectively unless you understand the underlying patterns.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you understand the underlying patterns and design forces, you can quite efficiently and effectively do your own thing.&nbsp; Either way, you&nbsp;want a strong core of design principles.&nbsp; </p>
<p>User interface technologies change.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll take a while, but WPF screens will eventually eclipse WinForms and who knows what&#8217;s over the horizon.&nbsp; The specific knowledge that you carry around about WinForms widgets will be obsolete soon.&nbsp; I think the Microsoft community stresses API knowledge too much and core design principles too little.&nbsp; When I switched jobs last fall I knew I was going to need a better foundation on WinForms, so I bought and read one of the more popular books on WinForms by a Microsoft luminary (and I say this without any irony).&nbsp; I read the book and it presented the technology behind WinForms very effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizards and designer support was well covered, but&nbsp;the book&nbsp;didn&#8217;t address the issues of maintainability and testability in WinForms development.&nbsp; There wasn&#8217;t a single mention of any kind of View/Controller separation in the entire book.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a huge gap in knowledge, and one I hoped to help fill by writing this series.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The way it&#8217;s unfolded, this series isn&#8217;t&nbsp;really about replacing the CAB with your own Model View Presenter pattern.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just the things you can&nbsp;do to make a maintainable&nbsp;WinForms architecture &#8212; with or without the CAB.&nbsp; A large chunk of maintainability for me is creating code that&#8217;s easy to test with granular unit tests, and you&#8217;ll see this desire for testability permeating the entire series.&nbsp; Despite rumors to the contrary, it is possible to Test Drive WinForms development, but you testability&nbsp;has to be a first class design goal.</p>
<p>One of the other points I wanted to get across in my DevTeach talk was that oftentimes a code-centric approach can accomplish user interface tasks faster and with less duplication than using the designer.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just now starting to explore some of these code-centric solutions through the later posts involving Fluent Interfaces.&nbsp; The designer is great for laying out the look and feel, but we can&#8217;t allow the designer to be our architect.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think WinForms is a bad technology at all, but it&#8217;s deeply flawed in the sense that it does not lead you into a maintainable structure.&nbsp; The designer makes it relatively easy to crank out user interface code, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s doing behind the scenes, but some judicious code-centric design can eliminate duplication and reduce the overall effort.&nbsp; Maintainability is your job, not the designer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>So hotshot, you think you can build a better CAB?</h4>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s not my point.&nbsp; My point was just that if you were well armed with an understanding of the underlying design patterns and motivation that you could&nbsp;happily evolve your own application specific framework that would better fit your application.&nbsp; Part of that belief is that building a framework is much simpler in this day and age of Dependency Injection tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, you can pull one of a couple different Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection tools off of the shelf that are all&nbsp;more powerful than the limited ObjectBuilder inside the CAB.&nbsp; Then again, I&#8217;m the progenitor of one of those tools, so my opinion might be somewhat suspect.</p>
<p>And yes, to be honest, like many developers there&#8217;s an inner demon inside of me that arrogantly&nbsp;believes he can build a better [insert name of framework] and is just dying to prove it.&nbsp;Begone inner demon, begone!</p>
