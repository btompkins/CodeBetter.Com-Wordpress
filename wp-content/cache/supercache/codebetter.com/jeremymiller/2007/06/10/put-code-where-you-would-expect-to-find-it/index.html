<p>I&#8217;m going to propose a new design concept with an admittedly awkward name called the &#8220;Put Code Where You&#8217;d Expect to Find It&#8221; Principle.&nbsp; It means exactly what it sounds like.&nbsp; A team should strive to consistently put different types of code into separate, logical places in the structure.&nbsp; Following this principle, I&#8217;m going to put security related code in a namespace with &#8220;Security&#8221; or &#8220;Authorization&#8221; or &#8220;Authentication&#8221; in its name.&nbsp; Data access code is going in &#8220;Data&#8221; or &#8220;Persistence&#8221; namespaces.&nbsp; Business logic is going to be placed in the appropriate&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model">Domain Model</a>&nbsp;class, or an accurately named <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2004/11/28/648.aspx">Use Case Controller</a> (if you swing that way) or <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">Service Layer</a>&nbsp;class.&nbsp; The point being, assuming a modicum of familiarity with a system, that you should be able to consistently and quickly find any piece of code by its functionality.&nbsp; Think of this principle as creating a <a href="http://www.tnrdlib.bc.ca/dewey.html">Dewey Decimal</a> system for your code.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Part of the &#8220;&#8230;Where You Expect to Find It&#8221; principle is to simply create and enforce some consistency within your system.&nbsp; On several of my Agile projects I&#8217;ve noticed &#8220;this is how we&#8217;re going to do it&#8221; moments when the team settles on a pattern to follow, then follows it.&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;re going to do data access with a repository class for each parent domain class object&#8221; or &#8220;I like this pattern, let&#8217;s use it&nbsp;for all web pages&#8221; or &#8220;let&#8217;s suffix all of our <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html">Gateway</a> classes with Gateway&#8221; are all examples.&nbsp; When these patterns are defined and applied consistently, it becomes easier to find the code you&#8217;re looking for.&nbsp; Defining, and refining, these patterns of a system seems to lead to big jumps in developer throughput and increases a team&#8217;s ability to exercise collective code ownership.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think the main reason to be excited about Ruby on Rails (RoR) and its ilk is improved software maintainability through <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php">Opinionated Software</a>.&nbsp; RoR forces web developers into a bit of a straight jacket, but that&#8217;s a good thing in a way.&nbsp; RoR enforces a consistent source code tree layout; a consistent division of responsibilities between model, view, and controller classes; and consistency in naming conventions for just about everything.&nbsp; While some of the design choices or limitations of RoR may be debatable, the advantages for maintainability are undeniable.&nbsp; Any experienced RoR developer is going to be able to quickly understand the patterns of a new RoR application because the &#8220;this is the way we do it&#8221; decisions have been made as a community and baked into the framework itself.&nbsp; RoR puts code where you&#8217;d expect to find it.&nbsp; My colleague also suggested <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Jakarta Commons</a> as another example of consistency.&nbsp; I&#8217;m still a little dubious about some of the details, but I&#8217;m starting to get much more interested in Software Factories as well for the consistency that they create.</p>
<p>Moving to a negative example, last year&nbsp;my team was&nbsp;extending our legacy web application and needed to find the code that governed the navigation bar at the top of each page.&nbsp; We finally found the code smack dab in the middle of a huge code file called &#8220;Security.asp&#8221; in the &#8220;_ScriptLibrary&#8221; system folder created by the old Visual Interdev tool.&nbsp; To make matters worse, we found three different versions of &#8220;Security.asp&#8221; scattered through the code tree.&nbsp; At this point we expect to find everything and the kitchen sink in the &#8220;Security.asp&#8221; file, but it was a terrible place to dump the navigation code.&nbsp; One, the name &#8220;Security.asp&#8221; doesn&#8217;t imply navigation logic, and two, a system folder is an unusual place for custom code.&nbsp; The application could be improved by simply moving the navigation subroutines into a separate &#8220;NavigationLibrary.asp&#8221; script in a logical folder.&nbsp; Then the people who come behind us <b>will</b> be able to find the navigation logic when we&#8217;re gone.</p>
<p>The newer Integrated Development Environment tools help quite a bit with this.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t want to live without ReSharper&#8217;s CTRL-N shortcut to find any class in the solution (with wild cards too!).&nbsp; Then again, finding code with ReSharper will be a whole lot easier if you employ good naming practices and put code where you would expect to find it.</p>

<p>What is design but the accumulation of a lot of little decisions?  Yes, things like Software Factories, Opinionated Software, and frameworks can help developers &#8220;fall into the pit of success,&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think you get great results unless the &#8220;right thing&#8221; is socialized and internalized by the developers themselves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s knowledge, experience, and diligence first, tools second.</p>

<p>I still want to know what things we can do to make it easier for developers to do the right thing.  Please don&#8217;t read into that sentence that the answer has to be a tool.</p>
<p>You said: &#8220;What is design but the accumulation of a lot of little decisions?&#8221;  Sure the tools mentioned help cut down on re-inventing of the wheel.  I don&#8217;t think that we have done as much as we should to cut down on re-invention of the wheel.</p>

<p>I thought you were talking about something else from the name.</p>
<p>I have run into my share of &#8220;systems&#8221; where the actual code was hidden through some layer of indirection.  One common thing that we all use (that I really hate and do my best to avoid) is where one write JavaScript code within a class&#8230; not a Page&#8217;s CodeBehind mind you, but some class in the system.  It might be in a Library project where the Page is passed to the class doing the work or it could be somewhere else&#8230; it really sucks when one comes later and has to figure this garbage out&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m tlaking ASP.NET and I know that you use RoR, so you probably have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about <grin />.  </p>

<p>I&#8217;m in a WinForms frontend and Java backend world actually.</p>
<p>I know exactly what you mean.  It used to piss me off to no end to inherit systems that wrote HTML and Javascript snippets in VB6 components.  </p>
<p>Think on this one though, a former colleague related a story to me one time of a team that built a dynamic website by building all the HTML output in PL/SQL stored procedures.  Top that!</p>
<p>I actually wrote this post last year at my previous employer.  Their main ASP.Net system has a single class nicknamed the &#8220;Borg&#8221; that is or contains:</p>
<p>* The Application Controller<br />
* Navigation controls<br />
* HTML construction<br />
* Data access<br />
* Generates Javascript<br />
* Transaction management</p>

<p>I think Jay is objecting to seeing Javascript embedded within C#/VB.Net code somewhere besides the code behind.  From experience, that&#8217;s painful beyond belief to troubleshoot and change.</p>
<p>If you need to codegen or use a template to build your Javascript, that&#8217;s not too bad, but keep that stuff out of the Controller&#8217;s in something like you&#8217;re suggesting.  </p>
<p>Then again, life will be much easier if you can quickly run and verify the Javascript without having to fire up an ASP.Net page.</p>

<p>In fact, TTM (The Total Mess) is sort of the standard you&#8217;ll see because very few companies want to spend to money or time to write software correctly.</p>
<p>Most of the time you have some point-headed CFO type screaming at the CIO who will then force the development team to cut corners, who after enough &#8220;crap&#8221; from their managers will just TTM it and go home for the day.</p>
<p>In corp America most dev&#8217;s as sent to the management track after 3-5 years anyway.  Seldon if ever will you find a programmer who knows how to do anything but TTM.</p>
<p>In fact, the CFO and CIO reward the TTM.</p>
