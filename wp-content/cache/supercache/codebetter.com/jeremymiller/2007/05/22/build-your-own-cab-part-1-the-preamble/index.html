<p>One of my favorite authors is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas,_p%C3%A8re">Alexandre Dumas</a>, author of the Three Musketeers books and the Count of Monte Cristo.&nbsp; The Three Musketeers was the&nbsp;soap opera&nbsp;of its day, written in installments as a serial&nbsp;in whatever passed for magazines in those days.&nbsp; Likewise, I&#8217;m going to try to dribble these posts out in little installments.&nbsp; Basically the size of post I can write in a single sitting on the train ride from and to work.</p>
<p>Note on terminology &#8212; I&#8217;m a card carrying Fowlbot, so I&#8217;m using the terms set forth in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/">Martin&#8217;s forthcoming book</a> on enterprise design patterns.</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s just the User Interface right?</h4>
<p>&#8220;Just&#8221; the user interface?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen this so much lately, but earlier in my career there was a definite attitude that User Interface (UI) programming was simple, grunt work &#8212; unworthy of the attention of the serious developer.&nbsp; In my mind I always think of the line &#8220;Just pick it up&#8221; from Caddyshack, or Kramer extolling Jerry to just &#8220;write it off.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s a dangerous attitude because user interface code can easily be much more complex than the server side code in many systems.&nbsp; It&#8217;s worth spending some mental cycles on the design and structure of the UI code.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating user interface code is time intensive.&nbsp; Not just in terms of the initial coding, but in my experience UI code&nbsp;generates the most&nbsp;defects and hence takes the most time to fix bugs.&nbsp; We can cut down the defects by extending unit testing as far into the user interface code as possible.&nbsp; TDD opponents often use the UI as an example of code that just can&#8217;t be tested.&nbsp; They&#8217;re wrong, but UI testability doesn&#8217;t come for free.&nbsp; It takes some care to craft a structure that makes UI code easier to test.</li>
<li>User interface code&nbsp;interfaces with an extremely unpredictable external dependency &#8212; those wacky users!&nbsp; It takes a great deal of care to protect the system from garbage input and user error.</li>
<li>The User interface changes frequently.&nbsp; Again, my experience is that it&#8217;s much easier for a user and analysts to get the backend logic requirements upfront than it is to specify the user interface.&nbsp; Making the UI code easier to change just makes sense, but that again takes some design cycles.</li>
<li>UI code is largely event driven, and event driven code can be nasty to debug.&nbsp; Again, testability and a cleaner separation of concerns makes that debugging either go away or at least become easier.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A Note about Design Patterns</h4>
<p>I know many people blow off design patterns as ivory tower twaddle and silly jargon, but I think they&#8217;re very important in regards to designing user interface code.&nbsp; Design patterns give us a common vocabulary that we can use in design discussions.&nbsp; A study of patterns opens up the accumulated wisdom of developers who have come before us.&nbsp; Finally, the design patterns we&#8217;re going to examine in this series give us a framework of ideas on the best way to divide responsibilities in our user interface code.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good thing because&#8230;</p>
<h4>User Interface code contains a lot of different responsibilities</h4>
<p>It was almost comical, but sitting in the Agile track at DevTeach almost every speaker, including me, had at least one slide dedicated to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a> (SRP).&nbsp; Just to recap, the SRP states that any one class &#8220;should have only one reason to change.&#8221;&nbsp; Basically, you should strive for each class to contain a single coherent responsibility or concern.&nbsp; Like I said before, UI code can easily become complex.&nbsp; Just to prove that point, let&#8217;s list some of the responsibilities that could easily be contained in a single screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual presentation&nbsp;to the user</li>
<li>Capturing&nbsp;to user input events</li>
<li>Input validation and business rules </li>
<li>Authorization rules </li>
<li>Customization </li>
<li>Screen flow and synchronization </li>
<li>Interaction with the rest of the application </li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of important things.&nbsp; Lots of things that would really be easier to code if I could just work on one thing at a time.&nbsp; Things I&#8217;d really like to be able to test in isolation from one another.&nbsp; Back to the Single Responsibility Principle, we can better enable change and improve&nbsp;maintainability in our UI code by assigning each of these responsibilities to distinct, loosely&nbsp;areas of the code.&nbsp; What we need is some sort of divide and conquer strategy for our WinForms code.</p>
<p>Of course, a large problem in WinForms development today&nbsp;is that the most common pattern of assigning responsibilities&nbsp;is&#8230;</p>
<h4>The Autonomous View</h4>
<p>You might not be running around saying &#8220;I&#8217;m building an application on the <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/AutonomousView.html">Autonomous View</a> pattern,&#8221; but you&#8217;ll recognize it in a heartbeat.&nbsp; The autonomous view is a single piece of code that encapsulates both presentation and screen behavior in one single lump of code.&nbsp; In WinForms the autonomous view is characterized by completely self-contained Form and UserControl&#8217;s.&nbsp; While it&#8217;s perfectly suitable for simpler screens, it can present some maintainability issues for screens of even moderate complexity because of the mixture of concerns.&nbsp; The biggest issue for me is that the code in an autonomous view is significantly harder to unit test than code in POCO classes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also potentially harder to understand because&nbsp;so many concerns are intermingled with the WinForms machinery.&nbsp; To some degree you can instantiate WinForms classes in memory and run unit tests against this code with or even without <a href="http://nunitforms.sourceforge.net/">NUnitForms</a>, but it&#8217;s often much more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To explain what I mean by the difficulty in testing, let&#8217;s look at this example..,</p>
<p>To be continued in Part 2:&nbsp; Humble Views</p>

<p>I was reading your post: &#8220;Build your own CAB #1 &#8211; The Preamble&#8221; and you did not provide any links to the next post in the sequence. Further, you don;t use categories, so I can;t find the other osts easily.</p>
<p>I just recommend that whenever you create a series that you also create appropriate link for Previous/ Next so that the readers can traverse through the series. </p>
