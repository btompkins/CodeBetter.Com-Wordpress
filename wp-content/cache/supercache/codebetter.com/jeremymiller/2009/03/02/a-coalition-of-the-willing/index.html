<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I had an interesting lunch last week with some of my Austin software development buddies.&#160;&#160; The poor fools, I mean, my friends, were sucked into one of those repetitive arguments on Twitter over the importance or utter uselessness on Twitter the evening before.&#160; You know, the one where the anti-sproc guys repeat the old <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2003/11/18/38178.aspx">Frans Bouma post</a> (it’s 6 years old for crying out loud) verbatim and maybe throw some extra points in about how sprocs are a huge PITA to TDD or even just test at all and add extra baggage to configuration management?&#160; And then the pro-stored procedure guys repeat all the old performance cargo cult stuff and say “I’ve always done it this way, and dadgummit I’m not going to stop now!,” or pull out the old nonsense about how they can much more easily deploy sproc changes instead of recompiling code? (Dude, if you’re scared to redeploy code, you need to improve your software engineering practices in a big way instead of independently modifying your database underneath your code).&#160; </p>
<p>My friends wanted to talk about how to be more effective in communicating to other developers about why stored procedures aren’t the best approach in most situations.&#160; Specifically, they wanted to know how to reach the developers who were staunchly pro-sproc.&#160; My response was simply to say that we should stop arguing with people who don’t want anything to do with what we’re peddling and just worry about the “Coalition of the Willing.”</p>
<p>My opinion here:&#160; If you seriously want to continue to place business logic in stored procedures, eschew OOP in favor of procedural code, stay with the Waterfall lifecycle, and refuse to adopt software engineering practices like continuous integration and Test Driven Development – it’s your business and none of mine.&#160; I refuse to spend any more of my time arguing with people that don’t want to change the way they do things.&#160; I’ve built software with stored procedures, RAD tools, procedural code, data-centric thinking, and labored inside the waterfall lifecycle.&#160; I’m completely done with that, and I refuse to work in any company that still insists on building software like that (unless it’s a matter of putting food on the table, in which case I won’t care ‘cause I’ll just be grateful for the job).</p>
<p>Do we really need to waste any more energy engaging with people who just simply don’t want anything to do with the techniques, practices, and principles that fall under the widespread ALT.NET banner?&#160; What’s the point?&#160; Is it important to convert the greater majority of the .Net development community who frankly doesn’t give a damn about Agile development, Domain Driven Development, or better testing practices?&#160; As long as we have a big enough population of developers that we can hire to work in an ALT.NET type of environment and Microsoft doesn’t do anything absolutely horrible that plunges us back into the dark ages, I say it’s enough.</p>
<p>Looking back on 2008, here’s my personal software development lows and highs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EF Vote of No Confidence wasn’t useful, and I’m very sorry in retrospect that I had anything to do with it.&#160; Yes, a few good conversations came out of it, but for the most part, did it make the slightest improvement in anything?&#160; EF version 1 is a severely flawed tool that will get incrementally better in version 2, but still fall very short of what I want out of a persistence tool even in that version 2.</li>
<li>I only wrote the original kernel of what has become Fluent NHibernate, but I’m very happy with what James Gregory &amp; co. have made out of that thing.&#160; (I’ll be a lot happier when it has a very solid Sematic Model underpinning and gets away from the direct coupling to the hbm.xml.&#160; You go Paul Batum!)</li>
<li>I’m proud of the StructureMap 2.5 rewrite (at a minimum, it’s a helluva lot better than the previous release and I learned a lot)</li>
<li>I had a blast with the pre-conference workshops at KaizenConf, and I think we shared a lot of new ideas about development</li>
<li>I think the wave of convention based techniques and real DSL approaches popping up in Windsor, StructureMap, FubuMVC, MassTransit, Fluent NHibernate, and others are going to make .Net development more efficient. I think the .Net OSS community is pushing the art of software development instead of just copying Java or Ruby projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice a trend?&#160; Bitching at Microsoft about EF was basically useless.&#160; Building new OSS solutions that made NHibernate easier to use was helpful.&#160; Arguing online with anybody on TheRuntime.com was a waste of time.&#160; The way that we’re helping each other with efforts like <a href="http://www.summerofnhibernate.com/">The Summer of NHibernate</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2008/06/24/foundations-of-programming-ebook.aspx">Karl Seguin’s Foundations of Programming</a>, and <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/tags/DDD/default.aspx">Casey Charlton’s ongoing DDD</a> series was awesome.&#160; </p>
<p>Let’s put our first efforts toward making our stuff as good as it can possibly be and helping out anybody who does ask us for help.&#160; Let’s still stay usefully engaged with Microsoft and the traditional .Net world, but back off from evangelizing anybody who doesn’t want to listen.&#160; Crusades against Microsoft or RAD Programming?&#160; Let’s leave that stuff behind in the dark ages of ALT.NET history where it belongs.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m fully aware that I’m implicitly stating that the ALT.NET way is the way – but I’d defend that just a little bit by pointing out that the ALT.NET “way” is very fluid and has changed in significant ways every year.&#160; For example, I’ve dropped my old TDD style in favor of a more effective BDD style.&#160; We’ve incorporated stricter DDD rules for our Domain Model at work that have added value.&#160; My team switched from XP style iterations to the Kanban style of rolling wave development (I seriously think that the Kanban style of continuous flow and adaptation is smoother and easier to use for a team than iterative cycles).&#160; My team uses DSL and FP techniques that weren’t even in my vocabulary 3 years ago to great effect.&#160; My point here is that we’ve happily adopted new things that have made our development efforts more successful and I have no doubt that even better ideas will pop up next year.</p>
<p>All of the above again proves my larger point here &#8212; we should focus more on advancing the art of software development than trying to convert the majority of the development population to whatever it is that we happen to be doing at this very moment.&#160; The people who are motivated and interested in coming along with us will come along.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And my friends would like to start a dialogue about how to usefully engage staunchly pro-sproc developers in a useful fashion.&#160; I’d be happy to take those comments here as well.</p>

I share your frustration.</p>
<p>I work in a management consultancy firm where the prevailing wisdom is to address software delivery risk with &#8220;more tools, more processes, and more upfront planning&#8221;</p>
<p>in this case I feel I have to continue to argue for change, because if I don&#8217;t our clients will suffer, and the firm I work for will be put at risk as we try to address these massive multimillion dollar projects with waterfall approaches and BDUF.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t give up with trying to evangelize your software development values. These ideas are gaining wider and wider traction in even the conservative circles, and many of the &#8220;traditionalist&#8221; while not becoming full converts, aren&#8217;t we starting to understand that there&#8217;s something real in all of this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true it&#8217;s no use preaching to those that refuse to listen, but you&#8217;re making a big impact on all kinds of people who are &#8220;sitting on the fence&#8221; and I think this is the year that many of these things didn&#8217;t really sentence and traction.</p>
<p>Regarding why Jeff</p>

<p>Everybody makes progress at their own pace. Things that are good may eventually not work out. Certain thought structures and approaches in Buddhism are just there to bring you to a higher level of understanding. From there on, they become useless! </p>
<p>Example Testing. I am quite happy with unit testing, even though I often end up testing interactions and behavior and my test meth names tend to be overly large <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  In contrast, I find the pure given/when/then stuff I can find in the Internet quite verbose and still leaves me wondering what can be driven by it. You have obviously reached a different level of understanding.</p>
<p>What is important is that at every level when a developer becomes aware that there can be much more method in his working than just trial and error, there must be teachers and literature ready to pick him up at that level. It is quite difficult to jump levels. Pupils can often walk the levels faster, provided they have a good teacher, but jumping them will lead to frustration.</p>

<p>So in general, I understand from your post that you&#8217;re saying online debates are pretty useless, and I agree with that. The only thing that you&#8217;ll get from an online debate is more frustration. I made the mistake again to go into such a debate very recently (about soft-deletes) and I concluded it&#8217;s been enough. </p>
<p>What I think is the core of this whole problem, and I think you ran into the same conclusion, is that it&#8217;s useless to think that you can convince somebody else that what YOU&#8217;re doing is great and what somebody else is doing is bad. It&#8217;s never that black-white, though often these discussions/debates are taking place in such a setting. </p>
<p>What might be better perhaps is simply stating what you think about the technology you&#8217;ve chosen to concur the problems faced every day and why you&#8217;ve chosen that technology, leaving the choice if it&#8217;s what the reader should choose or not to the reader. If the reader isn&#8217;t able to make that choice, so be it. </p>
<p>In that light, I found it a bit sad that you ended your great post with a weak ending where you indeed implicitly state that what ALT.NET provides is good, rest is bad, which IMHO is precisely what you argue against in the first half of the post: the time of stating what&#8217;s good/bad is over. </p>

<p>However, on the topic of &#8220;wasting energy&#8221; trying to engage with developers who are happy with their I&#8217;ve-been-doing-it-like-this-forever status quo, I&#8217;d make the point that it&#8217;s a daily reality for most of us that won&#8217;t go away quickly. I&#8217;d respectfully suggest that as a well-known, well-credentialled, &#8220;celebrity&#8221; developer (and I use the c word in a respectful sense and not as some kind of insult), you&#8217;re in a better position that most to insist upon working in a particular way. Those of us who don&#8217;t have that leverage are left to chip away at the old mentalities as best we can.</p>

I&#8217;ve always felt the us vs. them arguments were counter-productive to teaching new techniques.  The personal attacks that these arguments tend to devolve into, inevitably alienate developers who can&#8217;t always progress as fast as some would like.</p>
<p>I think things like the EF are a good example of Frank&#8217;s comment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody makes progress at their own pace. Things that are good may eventually not work out. Certain thought structures and approaches in Buddhism are just there to bring you to a higher level of understanding. From there on, they become useless!&#8221;</p>
<p>The EF isn&#8217;t the right tool for you becuase you have moved beyond its current abilities.  However, it is the right tool for many because it will get them thinking in ways they haven&#8217;t in the past and start them on the path.  A vote of no confidence just adds another barrier and likely hinders the progress you are trying to achieve.</p>

The people who come here are one of two people, a) people who already agree with most of what he is saying, or b) people who are looking for answers on how to do their job &#8220;better&#8221;.  The c) group, meaning those who are stuck doing things the &#8220;old&#8221; way, they aren&#8217;t coming to this site.</p>
<p>So really, he is preaching to the converted or to the pepole who are willing to listen.  The developers/managers who insist on building 2000 sprocs for every application aren&#8217;t here and never (or at least rarely) will be.</p>
<p>Overall it was a great article and recently I had come to the same conclusions.  It&#8217;s really not worth the energy arguing with someone who will never see your side, you just do what you can with those who will listen and always remain respectful of those who won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason these debates get termed &#8220;religious&#8221;. They&#8217;re not very different from their spiritual cousins. You&#8217;re rarely going to convince a person of one religion to convert to another just based on your own testimony. </p>
<p>People convert from one idea to another when they seek answers and find them, and their own brain/logic/reasoning skills tell them what to do. </p>
<p>Our best chance of having these ideas spread, as you and Frans have pointed out, is to simply provide solutions, talk about those solutions in the context of problems and pain we face, and why the solutions helps us. The reader will find your words if they&#8217;re looking for a solution or a way to overcome their own pain. But if they aren&#8217;t looking, then you can&#8217;t convert them. You can&#8217;t evangelize them into crossing over. </p>

<p>I would still use a sproc for edge cases, but I think those edge cases are getting fewer and fewer as the years go by.  I also don&#8217;t write batch processing systems or reporting systems anymore, and I think that&#8217;s the most likely spot to need/want a stored procedure.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do we test that we haven&#8217;t, ourselves, become religious?&#8221;</p>
<p>By the simple fact that we constantly change our mind.  You did read that section right?  I think that the fact that our tools and approach is always in a constant state of churn is a sign that we&#8217;re not really religious.  No, we&#8217;re not going back to RAD programming the Microsft way, but we&#8217;re definitely still moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do we test that we haven&#8217;t, ourselves, become religious?&#8221;</p>
<p>As an atheist, people always like to remind me that my lack of belief is just another form of belief. And they&#8217;re right, of course. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to disagree with Jeremy on this and say we (.Net folks) ARE religious. We have a &#8220;belief&#8221; or set of beliefs. Our belief happens to be &#8220;adapt, change, constant state of churn, find a better way, etc.&#8221; but it&#8217;s a belief system nonetheless. There are principles that guide the way we develop software. </p>
<p>And there&#8217;s NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Besides &#8211; how can you write opinionated software without having an opinion? <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>I understand it doesn&#8217;t suit RAD principles but in a large enterprise, the data is too valuable to be allowed to be directly touched by code. They have SQL dinosaurs that review every change of SQL you do to ensure data integrity. I don&#8217;t like, you don&#8217;t like it, but the business really doesn&#8217;t like it when someone screws up their data. Ultimately we do write software for the business.</p>

<p>That might be reality, but I don&#8217;t accept the gist of your argument.  It&#8217;s easier to keep data from getting screwed up if you can easily test the system, and sproc&#8217;s will always be harder to test than business logic in the middle tier.</p>
<p>Would you rather depend on human eyeballs alone, or human eyeballs plus automated tests?  Plus you should keep in mind that the tooling for middle tier languages are vastly better than that for T-SQL or PL/SQL.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not &#8220;I&#8217;m just being cool &#8217;cause I don&#8217;t use sprocs&#8221;  Give me a little more credit than that.  I really don&#8217;t believe that stored procedures as a gateway to the raw data is a viable or valuable strategy unless you&#8217;re stuck with a shared database between apps &#8212; and I think the shared database is a massive anti-pattern in enterprise architecture.</p>

<p>I did read the section about changing our minds.</p>
<p>I also believe I understand the implication that you&#8217;re making which isn&#8217;t explicit, that there is some way to distinguish between healthy churn and unhealthy churn.</p>
<p>The conversation I&#8217;d like to participate on is finding and measuring that distinction.</p>
<p>No metric is perfect, and some people will game the measurement system (adding lots of trivial test to improve coverage, for instance).  But, those of us working for real improvement could use a concrete measurement beyond just our current projects.</p>
<p>As business owners, and software product owners, we might use it like depreciation.  If we can show that a product loses value over time because it gets out of sync with current practice, we can make the case that investments in current practice are capitalizable even if they don&#8217;t add or improve features.</p>

<p>And this is in part what I meant (and said) to my friend Scott Bellware a few days ago (I think he fights WAY too much to try and get his points across, and IMHO it actually hurt what he says; he is crazy, but in actuality if all that vapor is removed, we&#8217;ll find more value in what he says <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8230;  </p>
<p>To listen and accept different perspectives is hard for anybody, sure we can argue and be simply flabbergasted, but at the end of the day, only through personal experience and hard work I believe true awareness can be achieved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a MAJOR beginner in these alt.net techniques, I&#8217;m starting, reading and experimenting with a bunch of new concepts, and believe right now I will get a lot of value from this; however, even tho I&#8217;m willing, I can&#8217;t do as I&#8217;m told just because&#8230; I must ALWAYS put myself in a position in which I can reach my own conclusions, I&#8217;ve found it is the only way to learn&#8230; </p>
<p>So, Scott, like jeremy says at the beginning&#8230; by all means disagree with me, but stop ranting and being so mad at me for trying to do BDD with nant; wrong? maybe yes&#8230; but at least I will be able to take your words as advice and not simply disregard as $!$#@$!%@!@$@$!.</p>

And this is why I caution against this kind of self-indulgent vanity when you have barely even begun to take your first steps.  It will force you to take the long way to knowledge rather than the direct route, and if you continue to choose to indulge yourself, you might join others who have gone before you and not get there at all.</p>
<p>I would be cautious about using Jeremy&#8217;s style as a model for my work.  We work to very different aims that inevitably beget different tactics.  You&#8217;re failing to take your analysis here beyond the trivial, but I recognize from our brief time together that this is more of a persistent pattern than a momentary lapse, and so I make allowances for it.</p>
<p>In the future, it would likely be more appropriate to take this kind of personal interchange to another medium, otherwise I might presume that your approach to debate is predicated on having safe and familiar surroundings and utterly lacking in courage, which I&#8217;ll likely just ignore in the future for its utter lack of honor and its conspicuous absence of particular glandular support.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also rather discourteous to Jeremy and his readers to invite tangential conversations into meaningful contexts that they are working to build through dialog and exchange.</p>

<p>The multi-faceted activism built into the entire effort goes above and beyond the very valuable goal of making EF better.  I appreciate that you see no purpose in protest, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that there wasn&#8217;t more in-play than the effort to improve the product, and that many of the objectives didn&#8217;t result in categorical successes.</p>
<p>The EF effort achieved two of the primary objectives I had in mind when setting the campaign in motion: it raised awareness, and it brought Microsoft to the table.  The hard part is sustaining, and let letting up, knowing that Microsoft has a long tradition of reverting back to less effective means when it feels that the heat is off.  Well, that&#8217;s what activists are for, and not all signatories understand the imperatives or can sustain the tactics of activism.</p>
<p>Not every problem can be solved in entirety with well-wishes and a thoughtful article.</p>

<p>I agree with you, but the business doesn&#8217;t and changing their minds will not happen. They saw too many examples of people screwing up the data to believe me. I can&#8217;t really blame them, they have teams of 100s of people working on their system and if one of them screws up a commit once every 6 months it&#8217;s enough for them to justify a lock down of SQL. They still believe in waterfall and control of the schedule. Changing their mind will not work.</p>
<p>I use the term believe since it&#8217;s not based on any facts. It&#8217;s based on the analogy of a building a house. Since they understand the analogy, they believe in the process.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like is a way to work with SQL dinosaurs and not against them. I&#8217;m an optimist&#8230;</p>

I also commented that I was after ammunition for why sprocs are bad.  </p>
<p>@Jeremy I really appreciate the things you guys (alt.net) do. I am still pretty &#8220;green&#8221; when it come the developing (I just graduated in June) and CodeBetter has been one of my go to places for design guidance. </p>
<p>I have recently stepped into more of a tech lead/architect role on my team. I want to steer the team more in the direction of OR/M and TDD. The move has been met with a considerable amount of resistance because they just do not want to let go of the sproc. </p>
<p>I am met with arguments such as: 1.) the sproc is an abstraction layer (contract) between the underling complexity of the database and the application 2.) the &#8220;behavior&#8221; of your application can be easily changed without redeploying 3.) the sproc is more secure and is recompiled (better performance) 4.) Mapping &#8220;hot to the tables&#8221; is simply unacceptable </p>
<p>I know you all feel that the sproc argument is &#8220;beating a dead horse&#8221; or a dead issue. I just want you all to know (alt.net) that i appreciate each and every discuss regarding the pros/cons of sprocs. Just remember that there are guys like me out there that need all the ammo they can get. </p>

<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t have used the word &#8220;never&#8221; when talking about people resisting change, instead I should have used something like &#8220;unlikely&#8221;.   </p>
<p>In the past 15 years of doing what I do I&#8217;ve found is that job security seems to trump all else for most people.  If change will risk job security, there will always be a group of people who will fight to maintain the status quo.  Those are the people who I believe will &#8220;never&#8221; change.</p>
<p>As to you question, my answer would be that you need to take things on a case-by-case basis.  No two people or organizations are identical.  I know that&#8217;s a BS answer but I&#8217;m not sure what else to say.  For example, if the person resistant to change is a CIO who is a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; type of person who constantly brags about past successes while not even remotely delivering at their current position (I&#8217;ve worked for two of these in my days), it&#8217;s not even worth the discussion, either suck it up or move on (in both cases I chose move on).</p>
<p>I should clarify that I think the percentage of people who refuse to change or accept new ideas is very low.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never really understood the &#8220;Proc&#8217;s are easier/safer to deploy&#8221; reasoning, because it&#8217;s simply not true.  While working at a company who used Oracle there were two incidents where the DBAs brought the entire Database to a screeching halt while deploying modified Stored Procedures due to the horrible structure of their Packages.</p>
<p>There are some cases where Stored Procedures make sense (ETLs come to mind), but deployment definitely shouldn&#8217;t be a criteria.  Let&#8217;s face it, a bad deployment on the DB can cause a lot more problems than a bad deployment of a single application.</p>

<p>re: Abstractions<br />
A sproc is *an* abstraction layer.  The issue is whether it&#8217;s the best choice for an abstraction layer, all things considered.  Sometimes, the answer might be yes, but those cases are almost infinitely more rare than vendor-driven technology users understand.</p>
<p>The issue isn&#8217;t whether you have *an* abstraction layer, it whether you have *the right* abstraction layer.  Without the right stuff in place, the potential for productivity takes a sharp dive.  That doesn&#8217;t make good business sense.</p>
<p>re: Behavior<br />
If you can change the behavior of your application&#8217;s core logic without re-deploying, then you&#8217;re likely not doing the due diligence to prove that those changes haven&#8217;t introduced malfunctions into the business system and damaged the business&#8217;s ability to achieve it&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p>Quick, easy, and assured deployment is a given: press a button, run a script, run some smoke tests.  If you don&#8217;t have the resources to do this kinds of assured automation, then you might need to look to reclaiming some of the productivity lost to using the wrong abstractions.</p>
<p>re: Performance<br />
All parametrized SQL, regardless of the abstraction from where it originates, is compiled by data servers like SQL Server.  There is very little business-significant performance gains to be had here.</p>
<p>re: Security<br />
The same security mechanisms that are used in, for example, SQL Server, to secure access to the execution of stored pros can also be used to secure access to the execution of commands against tables.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s little difference between the work needed to be done to accomplish either, and little difference in the outcomes.</p>
<p>the &#8220;behavior&#8221; of your application can be easily changed without redeploying 3.) the sproc is more secure and is recompiled (better performance) 4.) Mapping &#8220;hot to the tables&#8221; is simply unacceptable</p>
