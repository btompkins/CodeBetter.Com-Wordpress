If you are new here, you might want to <a href="http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/feed/rss/" rel="nofollow"><strong>subscribe to the RSS feed</strong></a> for updates on this topic.<div style="clear:both"></div><div class="greet_block_powered_by">Powered by <a href="http://omninoggin.com/projects/wordpress-plugins/wp-greet-box-wordpress-plugin/" title="WP Greet Box WordPress Plugin" style="text-decoration:none;">WP Greet Box</a> <a href="http://omninoggin.com/" title="WordPress Plugin" style="text-decoration:none;">WordPress Plugin</a></div><div style="clear:both"></div></div></div></noscript></div><p>I had a 3-4 way Twitter conversation with <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove/">Roy Osherove</a> today that left me hot under the collar even several hours later.&nbsp; The conversation basically played out like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roy:&nbsp; Boo hoo, new .Net OSS projects are using advanced features in C# that might make those tools hard to use in VB.Net</li>
<li>Me:&nbsp; Maybe, but I&#8217;m optimizing the user experience of these tools for C#.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to sacrifice user experience in favor of a little extra reach.&nbsp; Besides, VB.Net devs are a very small percentage of OSS users.</li>
<li>Roy:&nbsp; Jeremy is an anti-VB bigot!&nbsp; Who&#8217;s with me VB guys?&nbsp; VB guys can&#8217;t use or participate in OSS because they&#8217;re actively turned away by guys like Jeremy! </li>
</ol>
<p>and then Roy proceeded to present himself as the champion of all those poor dispossessed VB.Net developers with some cheap theatrics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>To you Mr. VB.Net Dev:</b></p>
<p>Stand up if you don&#8217;t like the way things are.&nbsp; I have never once gotten any kind of specific suggestion about how to make StructureMap more palatable for VB.Net usage.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve gotten complaints, and some questions (which I have answered), but not one single specific suggestion or patch that I recall.&nbsp; Mr. VB.Net developer, if there&#8217;s something you want or lack in an OSS framework that would make it easier/better to use that tool with idiomatic VB.Net, you know who&#8217;s probably most qualified and able to write that patch?&nbsp; You are!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t write software in VB.Net, and haven&#8217;t used VB.Net in anger since .Net was in and early beta.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get VB.Net idioms, and I don&#8217;t have visibility into VB specific issues.</p>
<p>And you know what?&nbsp; There isn&#8217;t a major OSS project on earth that doesn&#8217;t like getting patches.&nbsp; I would love to get real, useful contribution from the VB.Net community in regards to an improved user experience with StructureMap &#8212; but I&#8217;m not going to pay attention to empty complaints, and I&#8217;m certainly not putting up with vilification.</p>
<p><b>I&#8217;ll go a step farther, give me a usable patch for StructureMap for better VB.Net usage, and I&#8217;ll have it released within 48 hours on Sourceforge</b>. </p>
<p>Actually, now that I&#8217;m a bit calmer, take this to heart.&nbsp; OSS projects are owned by the community &#8212; meaning that you can pick up the reins and do something about a tool that lacks something you need or want.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be passive.&nbsp; Heck, you could even write your own.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t think that OSS projects are a friendly place for VB&#8217;ers?&nbsp; Start your own and make the .Net ecosystem even richer.&nbsp; Hell, it&#8217;s not rocket science after all.</p>
<p>And p.s,. you really need to get the VB.Net team to give you multiline Lambda functions in the next version of VB.&nbsp; Trust me, once you have them, you&#8217;ll never want to code in a language that lacks them ever again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As a leader of a notable OSS project how you respond will determine how far your reach is. </p>
<p>So question is, do you want to jump start VB.net uptake or not? I&#8217;m sure it falls under &#8220;nice to have&#8221; but hardly anywhere on your &#8220;must haves&#8221; well behind improving codebase and keeping that fluent interface top notch.  This is ok in the morality of OSS projects, but not everyone seems to dig this perspective, so be it, again you&#8217;re in good company.</p>
<p>Final note the &#8220;get me a patch&#8221; approach seems to suffer from chicken and egg, until you get more vb.net users, you&#8217;ll likely not get many vb.net patches, etc, etc, etc.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5067" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>VB.NET developers aren&#8217;t the ones using OSS.  In my experience they are often former Access / VB6 / ASP developers who wouldn&#8217;t dare stray from Microsoft because they&#8217;re already overwhelmed by Microsoft&#8217;s offerings.</p>
<p>The language itself just doesn&#8217;t seem to be geared toward those with a passion for development, and those who want to use every ounce of power a language offers.  It&#8217;s geared toward the &#8220;get it done&#8221; crowd. Lack of multi-line lambdas, line continuations, excess verbosity in everything, and on an on.  It&#8217;s like the language doesn&#8217;t want you to think outside its tiny little box.  Jeremy/StructureMap isn&#8217;t turning away VB.NET developers, the language itself is.</p>
<p>Hell, from what I&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;tiny little box&#8221; is still too big.  I routinely demonstrate &#8220;new features&#8221; of the language to fellow developers all the time.  The number of developers using a subset of VB.NET that matches Access or VB6 is disturbing.</p>
<p>I agree with your sentiment that VB.NET developers should step up.  But it simply isn&#8217;t going to happen because there&#8217;s no demand for VB.NET-friendly OSS.  If you get a patch, great, otherwise, I wouldn&#8217;t bother wasting time on it.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5069" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Funny you should ask/say this. During your xmas break I did try to use Structure map in VB and ran into some issues (probably knowledge based issues)</p>
<p>I went outa town right as you got back and didnt have time to chat you up yet.</p>
<p>When I get back lets spend some time on this and we&#8217;ll get some workable samples ready for VB coders.</p>
<p>I think VB.NET developers would definitely benefit from using Structure map for DI.</p>
<p>One thing that would greatly help. Can you create and post a simple C# version of an app that uses structure map. This needs to be a simple app and be fully functional. I.e fully configured and implmented. Think small and simple. 80/20 all the way&#8230;</p>
<p>To the community at large.. Jeremy did ask me to help put together a VB.NET sample before left. We just didnt get r dun yet.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-5070" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am a VB.Net developer and I use Rhino mocks and the new AAA syntax and I use Structuremap. But&#8230; I use C# in my testprojects so I can use the AAA syntax better. I am not saying that it isn&#8217;t possible to use in VB.Net it is just eassier and better looking in C#. And there are ways around the multiline lambda things which I have discussed on my blog before. It&#8217;s not fun but it happens. It just means switching to the bette tool for the job. For View things I don&#8217;t see a big difference between the two so I keep those in VB.Net for most other simpler tasks I also still use VB.Net. The switch (if needed) is easy. So if a VB.Net developer doesn&#8217;t feel comftorable with the library he is using or thinks that his code becomes messy because of it than just switch it&#8217;s easy.</p>
<p>And it is not because of the language that a developer is worse thats called over generalizing. </p>
<p>And yes the lack of multiline lambdas was the biggest misstake so far (in a long line of misstakes) but life isn&#8217;t perfect so I live with it, I won&#8217;t die because of it nor will I make less money.  </p>
<p>And for all those C# developers that look down on VB.Net developers just remember that C++ guys look down on you. </p>
<p>And I would like to say, like I said before, that I am very gratefull to Jeremy for what he has done.</p>

<p>The use of MS DragDrop/WYSIWYG RAD etc tools can be a conscious decision to use someone elses development and testing time (similar to using opensource or third party tools/frameworks) instead of developing it inhouse. (ie suffering Not-Invented-Here syndrome).</p>
<p>Admittedly, sometimes its just a poor decision too; As my mother used to say, use the right tools for the job.</p>
<p>Would it be a gross generalization to say that C# devs can have a tendency to get under the hood and waste massive amounts of time by over-architecting, while VB devs can waste time by doing the opposite of this?</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t about quality of VB devs at all, it&#8217;s specifically about the contribution, or lack thereof, to OSS projects from VB devs.  Unfortunately, you guys got screwed out of decent Lambda support.  Several OSS projects, all in C#, are using the Nested Closure pattern to great effect &#8212; but that renders it useless for VB.net users.</p>

But you know what? If I have a choice in the matter, I always choose VB. I like VB. I&#8217;ve liked VB since it first came out. I liked BASIC before that. I also liked Ashton-Tates dBase and Clipper, but that&#8217;s another matter.</p>

But then again, he also blogs so I guess he will give you a proper answer there.</p>
<p>Regarding VB.NET vs C#, I can&#8217;t imagine how someone interested on stuff like the tools advocated by the ALT.NET can stick to VB.NET, since there&#8217;s this huge predominance (nearly exclusivity) of C# samples, books etc. The only samples in VB.NET I see are the ones Stephen Walther do for ASP.NET MVC and even for those he is always justifying his choice to his guests, and always keeping it pretty simple; whenever he got to do something more advanced he switches to C#.</p>
<p>The whole promise of &#8220;use whatever language you want&#8221; that MS spread in 2000 is failing because the CLR is obviously developed with C# in mind, and then the other languages find ways to implement those features.</p>
<p>By the way, the fact the googling &#8220;VB.NET TDD&#8221; brings this very post to the top hit says a lot&#8230;. O_O</p>

<p>As people have mentioned the problem that VB devs have is that MS only released multi-line lambdas to C# instead of to both it and VB.NET. They are too useful to ignore, and especially help TDD remain manageable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this has meant that many of the ALT.NET tools have largely been too hard for devs working with VB.NET codebases to use. This hasn&#8217;t stopped us getting the principles involved and I work at a MS Gold Partner that uses SVN, CC and mbUnit/Gallio as a result.</p>
<p>Again, let me point out that this is not Jeremy&#8217;s fault. I believe that Roy&#8217;s original point was that if an OSS tool could be almost as useful without requiring the use of multi-line lambdas, then it would make it a much more attractive tool for devs working with VB.NET codebases.</p>
<p>I have NO choice as to the language that our main app is written in, the decision was made 8 years ago to convert ASP to ASP.NET using VB.NET instead of C#. Trying to do a major re-write just to allow devs to use some pretty new tools is NOT going to happen. However this pain point is here because well intentioned OSS devs chose to use something only available in one .NET language. I&#8217;m cool with that, but please, allow the rest of us to have our whinge &#8230; we do code with C# when it suits, but we cannot convert legacy apps over &#8220;just because&#8221;, and funnily enough we get paid to work with the legacy code.</p>
<p>Angus/Falkayn</p>

P.S. Microsoft if you&#8217;re listening:<br />
1. Get VB patched prior to VBX to include multi-line lambdas (or at least hurry up VBX).<br />
2. Make Chad an MVP.</p>

<p>At home I go for C# because I like how tightly I can express what I want to do.  Usually C# has more features to it compared to VB as well. When they both do pretty much the same thing, you usually go for what gives you more features.</p>
<p>I would say that most VB devs that want to grow naturally migrate towards C# where they can.  I have seen it with myself and others.  C# seems to get more love from Microsoft and the surrounding community although VB.NET still has more users (perhaps hobbyists in general?).</p>
