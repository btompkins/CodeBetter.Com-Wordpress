and design software.&nbsp; It might be worth the effort to stop and go back to<br />
first causes &#8212; just what quality or qualities do we want in our code?&nbsp;<br />
What are we trying to achieve?&nbsp; For me as a developer on enterprise software systems, that<br />
answer is easy.&nbsp; As far as I&#8217;m concerned, maintainability is the single most important quality of<br />
code.&nbsp; You might be tempted to say productivity, but since most of our time<br />
is spent modifying or extending existing&nbsp;code, that<br />
productivity is predicated upon the maintainability of the code.  Productivity over any extended duration, even within the initial<br />
project, can only be ensured by creating a maintainable codebase.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/">Jim Shore</a> launched a treatise called &#8220;<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Articles/Quality-With-a-Name.html">Quality with a Name</a>&#8221;<br />
laying out a powerful definition of good design.&nbsp; Quoting his conclusion<br />
(emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>A good software design minimizes the time required to create, <b>modify, and maintain the software</b> while achieving acceptable run-time performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Enterprise software systems change.&nbsp; Business rules change, technology<br />
platforms change, third party dependencies are upgraded.&nbsp; Again from Jim<br />
Shore,&nbsp;&#8221;&#8230;most software spends far more time in maintenance than in initial<br />
development.&#8221;&nbsp; Enterprise systems typically aren&#8217;t replaced because they<br />
stop working.&nbsp; The end of life cycle for an application or system is often<br />
brought about because the system has become too difficult, risky, or expensive<br />
to modify to keep up with evolving needs.</p>
<p>Maintainability has become a near obsession for me because I&#8217;ve spent much of the last two years modifying, extending, or flat out<br />
rewriting<br />
<a href="../../blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/category/1258.aspx"><br />
legacy code</a>.&nbsp; Inevitably, much of the code has proved to be difficult<br />
to to work with.&nbsp; Our efficiency has been hampered on multiple occasions<br />
because of bad existing code and poor or nonexistent development infrastructure.&nbsp;<br />
We&#8217;ve been noticeably faster when we&#8217;re working with the newer code written with<br />
TDD, NAnt builds, and FitNesse tests.&nbsp; Maybe more revealing, we&#8217;ve become<br />
much more efficient with our legacy code when we retrofitted a lot of test and<br />
build automation around the code.</p>
<p>Finally, one last quote from Mr. Shore:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…the <i>goodness</i> of a design is inversely proportional to the cost of<br />
		change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree, and this &#8220;manifesto&#8221; was originally going to be completely about coding and designing<br />
software for maintainability.&nbsp; I still think that the quality of the code is the single<br />
biggest<br />
factor in the longevity of an application, but in reflection, some of the biggest gains my team<br />
has made with our legacy systems has been the creation of more comprehensive build<br />
automation, faster builds, better configuration management, and a body of<br />
automated tests.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not just the code, it&#8217;s the entire ecosystem.&nbsp;<br />
Personally I think that continuous, adaptive design is the most reliable<br />
mechanism to arriving at a good design, but then again, continuous design is<br />
most easily accomplished when there is a high degree of feedback for any changes<br />
like automated builds and tests.&nbsp; So for the moment being, here is my<br />
vision for the practices and infrastructure you need around the code itself to<br />
create a maintainable software ecosystem.</p>
<h4>Answer these Questions with a Yes</h4>
<p>If you want to create a maintainable code environment, you&#8217;ll need to be able<br />
to answer all of these questions in the affirmative.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I find the code related to the problem or the requested change?</li>
<li>Can I understand the code?</li>
<li>Is it easy to change the code?</li>
<li>Can I quickly verify the changes?&nbsp; Preferably in isolation. </li>
<li>Can I make the change with a low risk of breaking existing features?</li>
<li>If I do break something, is it easy to detect and diagnose the problem?</li>
</ol>
<p>Unsurprisingly, my answers to these questions largely come from<br />
Agile/XP practices &#8212; Test Driven Development, Refactoring, Continuous<br />
Integration and Acceptance Testing.&nbsp; To answer yes to all six questions, I say you need very solid, clean, well-structured code and multiple layers of<br />
effective feedback to let you know when things are wrong and what exactly is<br />
wrong to quickly correct problems.&nbsp; Agile development is nothing but a set<br />
of practices to maximize feedback.&nbsp; Maintaining a high quality of code<br />
draws on much older practices and values, but I think that Test Driven Development<br />
and designing for testability are the single most effective mechanism to enforce<br />
some of the traditional definitions of good code structure that enable easier<br />
modification of code:&nbsp; separation of concerns, high cohesion, and low<br />
coupling.</p>
<h4>Journey to a Maintainable Software Ecosystem</h4>
<p>As a developer extending an existing system you&#8217;re often the<br />
protagonist in the the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a><br />
computer game.&nbsp; In Myst you&#8217;re a traveler exploring a strange world where<br />
all of the people have disappeared and you solve a series of obscure puzzles to continue along<br />
your journey.&nbsp; Now, let&#8217;s take a tour through my vision of a maintainable<br />
software ecosystem.&nbsp; Say you&#8217;re a developer tasked with making some<br />
extensions to an existing codebase, and the original developers have all<br />
disappeared.&nbsp; Unlike Myst, in this healthy ecosystem there should be a sign<br />
or signs at every point to say &#8220;go here next&#8221; or &#8220;you have a problem right<br />
here.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I start by finding a brief document or Wiki page that tells me what software<br />
has to be installed for the code (IIS, Sql Server/Oracle, etc.) and the all<br />
important location of the source control repository.&nbsp; When I retrieve the<br />
root of the source repository I also get a copy of everything else that the code<br />
needs to execute and the master build script.&nbsp; I then run that build script<br />
that compiles the code, sets up all of the necessary environment configuration,<br />
and runs a set of unit and integration tests.&nbsp; As soon as I see this build<br />
finish successfully, I&#8217;m reasonably assured that my box is able to execute the<br />
code.&nbsp; Once I have the code opened on my box, I can see that the code is<br />
well factored and largely orthogonal in structure.&nbsp; I&#8217;m able to find the<br />
place where my new code should go and the patterns that the existing code<br />
follows so I can maintain some consistency.&nbsp; Because the code is loosely<br />
coupled, I can add my new code and easily unit test it in isolation without<br />
having to deal with much of the existing code.&nbsp; Once the new code is<br />
complete I run the build script again, and assuming the build script succeeds, I<br />
check the new code back into source control.&nbsp; A continuous integration<br />
server detects the changes, builds the latest code on the clean build<br />
environment, runs a more exhaustive suite of automated tests, and finally<br />
creates a deployment package that can be used to push the code to a testing<br />
environment.&nbsp; I can confidently push the code quickly into production<br />
because there is a near comprehensive suite of automated regression tests that<br />
largely reduce the cost and risk of regression testing.&nbsp; The risk of<br />
propagating code is minimized by a self-diagnostic deployment strategy that can<br />
tell you what and when something is deployed incorrectly.</p>
<p>The previous paragraph doesn&#8217;t have to be just an imaginary place.&nbsp; It&#8217;s<br />
obviously easier to accomplish with &#8220;Greenfield&#8221; code, but it might be more<br />
important to get that existing, strategically important codebase to<br />
that state.</p>
<h4>Invest in Continuous Integration Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Of all the practices in Agile development, the one practice that I would<br />
recommend without reservation is<br />
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"><br />
Continuous Integration</a>.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re a team brand new to Agile or XP<br />
development and looking for a place to get started, I say start with CI (with<br />
TDD an immediate second).&nbsp;&nbsp;I<br />
recently read an article that aptly describes Continuous Integration as having<br />
<a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/BetterSoftware/magazine.asp?fn=cifea&amp;id=58">a continual<br />
conversation with the system</a>.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re not already familiar with CI, it&#8217;s<br />
the practice of running a full integration build on the most current version,<br />
usually including environment setup and unit tests, on every single check-in to<br />
the source control repository.&nbsp; The Continuous Integration infrastructure<br />
is most effective when it&#8217;s coupled with a developer attitude of frequent<br />
check-ins.&nbsp; A lot of<br />
teams approach an automated build script as overhead, a nice thing to do, but<br />
one that can be skipped in a time crunch.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; A comprehensive<br />
automated build script is <b>strategic</b> to maintaining<br />
productivity over the lifecycle of a system.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an investment, not a<br />
cost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good CI infrastructure and process <b>can</b> reduce friction in working with a codebase by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster feedback from any changes made to the system</li>
<li>Providing better transparency into the changes happening to the system</li>
<li>Propagating environmental changes and code changes more rapidly <b>while<br />
	maintaining control</b></li>
<li>Ease integration issues by dealing with them earlier in smaller chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>A vexing problem in maintaining an existing codebase is not being able to<br />
exercise the code in your immediate development environment.&nbsp; After all,<br />
how can you really know that the code works if you can&#8217;t run it?&nbsp;<br />
Enterprise applications almost always have dependencies on external libraries<br />
and specific server configuration.&nbsp; Too many times I&#8217;ve seen developers<br />
stopped in their tracks because of issues with their development environment.&nbsp;<br />
In the past, I&#8217;ve spent up to a couple of weeks just trying to get an existing codebase to<br />
function on my workstation before I could begin writing new code.&nbsp; That<br />
time is inefficiency, and a preventable waste of time.&nbsp; Even with a build<br />
script I&#8217;ve seen developers spend days trying to work out the kinks in their<br />
system to make the build script function.</p>
<p>The best answer in my playbook is a completely comprehensive automated build<br />
script backed up with a modicum of documentation.&nbsp; Obviously, you&#8217;re not going to install Sql Server<br />
or Apache from the build script.&nbsp; Other than big ticket items, the build<br />
script should completely lay down all of the environmental dependencies.&nbsp;<br />
Our build script will build a local copy of the database, setup virtual<br />
directories on IIS, register COM (must die) dependencies, installs the windows<br />
services, and make all of the relevant registry entries necessary to execute the<br />
code.&nbsp; Theoretically, we could bring a brand new developer in and get the<br />
entire suite of applications running on the new workstation in a couple hours<br />
(if we were ever allowed to hire again anyway).&nbsp; Even with an unchanging<br />
team that&#8217;s important because the application itself is always changing.&nbsp;<br />
Every new project we build adds new environmental changes to the system.&nbsp;<br />
Keeping all of the setup in the automated builds helps to get these changes<br />
propagated to the other developer workstations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a scenario that&#8217;s unfortunately common in the .Net world (I have no .&nbsp; A<br />
developer or a pair builds a new feature that depends on a third party library.&nbsp;<br />
The third party library comes with an MSI that puts the assemblies in the GAC.&nbsp;<br />
The developers continue on with the development on their workstations and<br />
everything works perfectly &#8212; until that code is moved to a different box.&nbsp;<br />
If the team uses a Continuous Integration [link] strategy, that problem is going<br />
to be spotted immediately.&nbsp; If the team is being diligent about their<br />
Continuous Integration strategy they&#8217;ll automatically add the new environment<br />
setup to the source control tree and build scripts.&nbsp; Even if they don&#8217;t,<br />
the CI build is going to give them immediate feedback that there is environment<br />
setup missing </p>
<p>One of the most pernicious velocity killers is friction or uncertainty with<br />
migrating code between development to testing and production servers.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve<br />
seen shops try to beat the issue with lots of ceremony and paperwork, but it&#8217;s<br />
an inefficient and ineffective mechanism by itself.&nbsp; I watched one team<br />
take up to a week to setup a testing environment for a particular branch of the<br />
code &#8212; and they had to do this a dozen times a year.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve beat the issue<br />
by automating everything that moves.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve extended our Continuous<br />
Integration infrastructure to include moving successful builds to our testing<br />
servers on demand.&nbsp; We built<br />
<a href="../../blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/04/06/142431.aspx"><br />
environment testing</a> into our code to quickly troubleshoot and detect<br />
problems with an installation of the code.&nbsp; We have not had a single<br />
problem with a testing deployment since.&nbsp; Speeding up the feedback cycle between development and<br />
testing has certainly helped us, but the improved reliability and control over<br />
the testing migrations has made a tremendous difference.&nbsp; The end result<br />
for us is the ability to quickly shift code from development to testing, know<br />
that the installation is valid, and all the while have accurate traceability<br />
from the build products being tested to the exact version of the source code.&nbsp;<br />
It&#8217;s a great balance of speed versus control with relatively little developer<br />
overhead once you&#8217;re past the initial creation of the build infrastructure.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17"><br />
Capistrano</a> project from the Ruby world.&nbsp; Envision a world where you can<br />
reliably do production code pushes and rollbacks with a single mouse click.&nbsp;<br />
If you had that ability, and some shops already do, how much faster could you<br />
deliver new features and fixes? How much more incrementally and iteratively<br />
could you work (think Google)?&nbsp; If a production push is scary, or takes an<br />
act of congress to move through your process, your system isn&#8217;t going to be that easy to maintain<br />
&#8211; even if the code is pristine.  Someday<br />
<b>I&#8217;d</b> like to have the one click production push.</p>
<h4>Getting the Source Code Under Control</h4>
<p>You have to be able to find the right code, and preferably without spelunking<br />
through an ancient VSS repository.&nbsp; There needs to be a<br />
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#MaintainASingleSourceRepository."><br />
single, authoritative source for the code and its dependencies</a>.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that using source control software is nearly<br />
mandatory in any professional software endeavor.&nbsp; My colleague and I have<br />
between us given four presentations on Continuous Integration in the last 18<br />
months.&nbsp; After every single presentation somebody approached us with a horror story of a<br />
multi-developer team working today without any source control.&nbsp; That&#8217;s<br />
borderline insane, but just using source control may not be enough.&nbsp; One of<br />
our mission critical subsystems has its source code scattered across a couple<br />
different repositories, none of which can be said to be the authoritative master<br />
repository.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a major source of concern.&nbsp; A<br />
sadly common anti-pattern in software development is creating build products<br />
directly on a developer workstation and migrating those products.&nbsp; At this<br />
point it doesn&#8217;t matter if the compiled build products themselves are checked<br />
into source control because they aren&#8217;t traceable.&nbsp; We did this routinely<br />
at one of my previous jobs.&nbsp; Two years after I left I got a call from a<br />
friend of mine who had checked out a VB6 project I&#8217;d written to fix a production issue.  It wouldn&#8217;t compile because a class file was missing.  Oops.</p>
<p>Again going back to first causes, what I want to achieve in my software<br />
ecosystem is the ability to accurately trace at all times the build products<br />
installed on testing, development, and production environments to the exact<br />
versions of the code.&nbsp; It&#8217;s awfully hard to diagnose problems in production if you&#8217;re not sure which version of the code you should be looking at.  In the example above we had a formal process<br />
recording production and testing migrations, but no real traceability from the<br />
installed binaries to the exact source code.&nbsp; Good traceability doesn&#8217;t<br />
have to be difficult.&nbsp; For us, traceability is almost a byproduct of using<br />
Continuous Integration.&nbsp; The first step is to simply get all of the code<br />
and <b>anything</b> that&#8217;s necessary for the code to function into the source control<br />
repository.&nbsp; Continuous Integration is only effective if there is a single,<br />
authoritative repository for the source.  Part of our CI build is embedding the<br />
<a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/">CruiseControl.Net</a> build number into all of the .Net assemblies.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just<br />
a <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/release/latest/help/tasks/asminfo.html">NAnt<br />
task</a> that looks like this from my StructureMap build file:</p>
<div style="border: 1pt solid windowtext;padding: 0pt;background: white none repeat scroll 0%;font-family: Courier New;font-size: 10pt;color: black">

<p>At the end of each successful CI build (compile, unit tests, integration<br />
tests), CruiseControl.Net creates<br />
<a href="http://odetocode.com/Articles/337.aspx">tags the source control repository</a><br />
with the CruiseControl.Net build version.&nbsp; Only successful, versioned<br />
CruiseControl.Net builds are ever migrated to testing or production.&nbsp; The key point is that we can pull a version number off of one<br />
of the assemblies on the test server and immediately find the exact version of<br />
the code from the source control repository.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the database, either.&nbsp; Database changes have a bad<br />
tendency to fall through the cracks.&nbsp; Treat the database schema as just<br />
part of the code.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a stupid, unnecessary risk to put database code<br />
through a completely different change management process than the code.&nbsp; It<br />
almost guarantees that the code will not be synchronized with the version of the<br />
database schema.&nbsp;<br />
The idea of a DBA being able to push stored procedure code directly to<br />
production needs to be abandoned.&nbsp; The database schema scripts need to be<br />
completely under source control and part of the automated builds.&nbsp; Changes<br />
to stored<br />
procedure code or DDL scripts should not move to production until it&#8217;s been<br />
through a successful integration run of the CI infrastructure.&nbsp; Again, back<br />
to<br />
first causes.&nbsp; You want reliable traceability between the version of the<br />
middle tier and the version of the database schema.&nbsp; Continuous Integration with the database can be tricky.  I&#8217;m more than a little intrigued by the<br />

even for non-Ruby development.</p>
<h4>Automated Unit Tests</h4>
<p>My experience is that<br />
<a href="../../blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2005/07/20/129552.aspx"><br />
good unit tests</a> help maintainability immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other<br />
hand, unit tests that are brittle, hard to understand, and too tightly coupled<br />
with the implementation may only make things worse.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re afraid to<br />
change the code because too many unit tests will break, you&#8217;ve got some serious<br />
problems in either your tests or the code structure (brittle unit tests are a<br />
code smell).&nbsp; Writing good unit tests is a very large topic in and of<br />
itself, but suffice it to say that it behooves you to spend some time learning<br />
more about writing good unit tests.&nbsp; I suspect that a lot of the failure<br />
stories we see from people trying TDD result from not understanding how to write<br />
good unit tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a solid safety net of regression testing to enable<br />
	refactoring.&nbsp; While I think refactoring is necessary to arrive at a<br />
	good design in any situation, refactoring is an absolute necessity as the<br />
	function of an application evolves.&nbsp; For instance, in my current<br />
	project I needed to reuse some large pieces of functionality from the<br />
	application in a completely different context.&nbsp; The first thing we did<br />
	was to refactor the code so that we could call the smaller pieces of<br />
	functionality without the application workflow as a whole.&nbsp; The only<br />
	reason we were able to do this refactoring safely was a series of FIT style<br />
	tests we had written as regression tests.&nbsp; We made a series of small<br />
	changes and ran the test suite after each change, occasionally backing up to<br />
	reverse a code change when a test failed. </li>
<li>Creating a specification for the usage of each class with readable examples<br />
of the API.&nbsp; If the test is readable, it should act as documentation for<br />
the code that it exercises.&nbsp; I often refer to unit tests to see how to use<br />
class that I didn&#8217;t write.&nbsp; We rely very heavily on a multitude of open<br />
source tools that are notorious for a lack of documentation.&nbsp; In several<br />
cases I&#8217;ve been able to pop open the code and read the NUnit tests to discover<br />
how to use a feature.&nbsp; Unlike an external document or even NDoc style comments, the<br />
best thing about making unit tests act as documentation is that the unit tests<br />
cannot diverge from the code without failing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the specification and regression safety net qualities of TDD are<br />
	maximized by creating fine grained tests that are easily understandable.&nbsp;<br />
	When we inherited our legacy application last fall all that came with it<br />
	were a series of coarse grained integration tests that would fail without<br />
	any useful failure messages.&nbsp; It was almost impossible to troubleshoot<br />
	the tests without putting a debugger on the code and following it from end<br />
	to end.&nbsp; Those tests did not aid in refactoring because they didn&#8217;t<br />
	really diagnose a problem, only report that there was a problem.&nbsp; Over<br />
	time we&#8217;ve moved to FIT style tests that exercise smaller pieces of<br />
	functionality at a time that are easier to control.&nbsp; These tests have<br />
	been far better as a safety net because they can give us much more context<br />
	around the exact reason for the failure.&nbsp; In our newer code we&#8217;ve<br />
	written TDD style from the beginning a failed unit test will point to a very<br />
	small area of the code, making the diagnosis for the cause of the failure<br />
	much easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.daveastels.com/files/BDD_Intro.pdf">I haven&#8217;t internalized<br />
	it completely, but I definitely like where the<br />
	</a><a href="http://blog.daveastels.com/files/BDD_Intro.pdf">Behavior Driven<br />
Development</a> (BDD) advocates are going.&nbsp; Even if BDD leads to nothing<br />
but writing unit tests with cleaner syntax I would call it a success.&nbsp; The slight shift in semantics from &#8220;Test-&#8221; to &#8220;Behavior-&#8221; is<br />
important.&nbsp; I think we will be better off when the emphasis is more on<br />
creating an executable specification of the expected behavior in the small<br />
versus &#8220;at some point I need a unit test for each method on each class.&#8221;&nbsp; TDD/BDD is supposed to be an exercise to define what the code<br />
is supposed to do and then ensure that the code does lead to the expected results.</p>
<h4>Executable Requirements for Less Expensive Regression Testing</h4>
<p>Code isn&#8217;t useful unless it does what it is meant to do <b>and</b> continues to do<br />
what it is meant to do.&nbsp; Assuming that you actually have the correct<br />
requirements from the business, what&#8217;s the best and most efficient way of<br />
verifying the code against the requirements, now and later?&nbsp; After all,<br />
regression testing is one of the most expensive items in software maintenance.&nbsp;<br />
One answer is to implement the detailed requirements as automated tests.&nbsp;<br />
The obvious benefit is that running the tests ensures, or at least detects, that<br />
the code still fulfills the requirements.&nbsp; Automated tests as a requirement<br />
document also has a significant advantage in that it reduces duplication between<br />
a requirements document and the testing plan.&nbsp; Instead of keeping two sets<br />
of documentation synchronized with each other and the code, you have one source<br />
of information that can be automatically reconciled against the code.&nbsp;<br />
Another huge advantage of specification by automated test is the removal of<br />
ambiguity from the requirements.&nbsp; A test succeeding or failing is a binary<br />
decision, there&#8217;s no room for ambiguity the same way there is in fuzzy &#8220;the<br />
system shall&#8230;&#8221; type requirement documents.</p>
<p>Okay, the first couple of objections to automated tests as requirements are<br />
that non-developers won&#8217;t be able to understand or write the automated tests.&nbsp;<br />
Not true.&nbsp; Personally,<br />
I&#8217;m a big fan of expressing<br />
<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Agile-Requirements.html">detailed<br />
requirements in FIT</a> style automated tests.&nbsp; You can write FIT tests<br />
that are human readable by non-developers (not that developers are non-human,<br />
but&#8230;), especially since you can quite happily mix prose with the test tables.&nbsp;<br />
FIT tests used to be limited to table driven tests, but with the addition of the<br />
&#8220;flow&#8221; style test fixtures in the<br />
<a href="http://fitlibrary.sourceforge.net/">FitLibrary</a> you can effectively write automated tests in English sentences.</p>
<p>Test automation isn&#8217;t going to be a silver bullet, but it goes a long, long<br />
way to enabling change in software systems &#8212; especially when the tests are run<br />
automatically as part of your Continuous Integration tests.&nbsp; If you can<br />
catch regression bugs by the automated tests almost immediately upon checking in<br />
the code, you can usually fix them faster.&nbsp; I definitely think that you can turn bug fixes around much faster when you can take care of things completely<br />
on your own workstation without having to go through the formal bug workflow.&nbsp;<br />
Test automation is especially effective when the developers can execute the<br />
tests on their own workstations.&nbsp; That can cut the feedback cycle down<br />
immensely.</p>
<p>Badly written automated tests<br />
can even cause more effort and trouble than gain.&nbsp; The same qualities of a<br />
good unit test apply just as much, if not more so, to acceptance testing.&nbsp;<br />
Good automated testing does not automatically equivocate to FIT either.&nbsp;<br />
The key point is to create tests that are easy to understand, reviewed, and<br />
hopefully written by the business experts.&nbsp; Ruby or Python scripting seems<br />
to be another alternative for testers to<br />
<a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2006/06/15#wireframe">create<br />
readable, automated tests</a>.</p>
<h4>How about Documentation?</h4>
<p>I haven&#8217;t mentioned much about the type of system level documentation<br />
that needs to exist.&nbsp; To be honest, if you engage me in a conversation<br />
about how to make a software ecosystem maintainable I would probably forget to<br />
even talk about documentation.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve all heard the mantra &#8220;the code is the<br />
documentation&#8221;, and I actually believe that, but with some additions.&nbsp;<br />
Ideally, I think that comprehensive &#8220;documentation&#8221; for a codebase is this troika:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intention revealing code</li>
<li>Solid automated test coverage</li>
<li>A complete automated build script.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the automated build scripts should be able to set up<br />
a clean development environment to run the application.&nbsp; If that is really<br />
true, then the build automation script is the single most authoritative source<br />
of information about the required environmental setup for the application or<br />
system.&nbsp; Even better yet, the build automation script can&#8217;t diverge from<br />
reality if its being run constantly.&nbsp; The same thing applies to automated<br />
acceptance testing.</p>
<p>So, back to the question of what documentation do you need?&nbsp; I say just<br />
enough to fill in the gaps between the code, the build script, and the tests.&nbsp;<br />
The big danger of documentation is the risk or overhead of keeping the<br />
documentation synchronized with the current state of the code.&nbsp; If<br />
documentation simply duplicates information that could be gleaned from the code,<br />
I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth writing.&nbsp; I fall into the camp that says the<br />
overhead cost doesn&#8217;t justify the effort of comprehensive documentation.&nbsp;<br />
More succinctly, I put a much higher priority on readable code, readable<br />
automated tests, and solid build automation than I do on documentation.</p>

<p>How do you reconcile an agile development process with the need for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and to provision hardware for applications ahead of time?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no critic of agile, but I have recently come into a work environment where we have a fairly rigid release process. I see the upsides to it for revenue systems and for the production environment, but I&#8217;d like hear what your thoughts are on how to cohabitate an agile process with a strict change control oriented release management process.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>I&#8217;ve honestly kept my head in the sand for the most part on SoX compliance.  I mostly think that SoX just adds more activities on top of your development practice.  You could use automated acceptance tests, that you&#8217;d like to do anyway, for enforcing and documenting some of the SoX compliance.</p>
<p>For auditing, I think there are some lightweight tracking things you can do to trace a release to user stories completed to acceptance tests that would go a long way.</p>
