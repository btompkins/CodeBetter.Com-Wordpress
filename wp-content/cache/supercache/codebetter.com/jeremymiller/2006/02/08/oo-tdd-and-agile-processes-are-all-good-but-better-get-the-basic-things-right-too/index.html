<p>Case in point from a conversation I had with a colleague at lunch today, the legacy&nbsp;systems that my team centers around share a database that lacks&nbsp;some logical&nbsp;referential integrity checks and uniqueness constraints.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were groaning that&nbsp;the database schema allows a motley collection of orphan records and duplicate data that is&nbsp;making our lives harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#8217;s the kind of activity that I would consider so intrinsic to building software that I wouldn&#8217;t even think to talk about it, but the effect of&nbsp;the&nbsp;missing database constraints has caused us some difficulties.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t say that all of us need to be experts, but I think every single enterprise developer needs to have some level of comfort&nbsp;with referential database theory.</p>
<p>Here are&nbsp;some other basic&nbsp;things that I think fall through the cracks a bit if you&#8217;re not paying attention:</p>
<ol>
<li>Database indexes.&nbsp; Too&nbsp;much, too little, or just the&nbsp;wrong indexing&nbsp;will drag your code down</li>
<li>The ACID rules and transactional boundaries.&nbsp; I think the mass majority of systems I&#8217;ve seen do a bad job of governing their transactional boundaries.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;look&nbsp;those jokers&nbsp;didn&#8217;t use the&nbsp;perfect transaction isolation level there,&#8221; I mean zero transactions at all.&nbsp; When things blow up and go wrong, will your code and database end up in an invalid state?&nbsp; Will you lose data?&nbsp; Drop messages?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not just important for database development either, you also need to consider the interaction with any kind of external system or messaging infrastructure as well.</li>
<li>Database archiving.&nbsp; Databases can get awfully slow when table sizes get bigger.&nbsp; I watched a batch processing&nbsp;system&nbsp;implemented by a very large and prominent consulting company (here comes the script kiddies!) become almost useless in its 6th week of production due to severe performance problems.&nbsp; The culprit?&nbsp; A very poor database design from the software vendor was compounded by the lack of a database archiving strategy.&nbsp; I got to lead a team that built a replacement a couple months later.&nbsp; Our system archived records the second that the workflow was completed.&nbsp; Our throughput was 2 orders of magnitude higher.</li>
<li>File system archiving.&nbsp; Weird, nasty things happen when servers run out of disk space.</li>
<li>One of the things I love about .Net over the &#8220;Set objEverything = Nothing&#8221; nonsense in VB6 is garbage collection, but it isn&#8217;t magic.&nbsp; Gotta make sure that unmanaged resources are cleaned up.</li>
<li>Database connection discipline.&nbsp; One of the many reasons I think we all need to <a href="/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2005/07/07/130095.aspx">stop writing so much ADO.Net code by hand</a> is to eliminate the possibility of screwing up database connection usage.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been told this isn&#8217;t as big an issue with the newer Oracle and Sql Server versions as it was 5 years ago, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet the farm on the database being able to handle a couple thousand orphaned database connections.</li>
<li>This is probably rare, but I had to fight with an XP zealot PM over this one time.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re going to&nbsp;use some sort of offline&nbsp;pessimistic lock, you need to have some sort of mechanism to&nbsp;clear out&nbsp;stale locks.&nbsp; Things will go wrong.</li>
<li>Adequate tracing and auditing &#8211; that is easily accessible and useful to the production support folks.&nbsp; In Agile process speak &#8211; remember that the&nbsp;production support organization&nbsp;is an important stakeholder in your project.&nbsp; In my case we&#8217;re the&nbsp;support as well, so I think we&#8217;ll care a bit about this one.&nbsp; On the other hand I detest code with too much tracing because I think it obfuscates the code and generates too much noise to be useful.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Coding standard.&nbsp; Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds but the hallmark of a smoothly running software team.&nbsp; This is called out very specifically by XP as a core practice, but&nbsp;I think my company has done a poor job of developing and following a coding standard in the past.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen Agile teams screw themselves by taking a too literal approach to the XP ideals by putting on the blinders and only focusing on the functional requirements from the customer.&nbsp; There are additional technical requirements that could be termed a &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221; expense for building a system.&nbsp; You have to&nbsp;fulfil these requirements to make the system viable.&nbsp; It&#8217;s our responsibility as developers and architects to&nbsp;communicate these issues to the project manager&nbsp;to insure&nbsp;these&nbsp;purely technical stories are adequately accomodated by the iteration and release&nbsp;plans.&nbsp; Now, what to do when the PM doesn&#8217;t listen to you?&nbsp; Um, run away?</p>

I would offer a reason why these things &#8220;fall thru the cracks&#8221; of Agile conversations.<br />
TDD is the hot thing in agile conversations, and I agree totally.<br />
But Design By Contract is another very powerful tool that I rank right alongside test-driven design in my toolchest. And agilites seem to have only a light-weight undestanding of the theory of software contracts.</p>
<p>Every time I code some code (C# or SQL schema, or whatever), I ask &#8220;What contracts can I put in here to better express what this module (class, method, database table, etc..) can and cannot do?&#8221;</p>
<p>So in my philosophical world, Design-by-Contract (DbC) should pervade everything just like Test-Driven Design (TDD) should. </p>
<p>If you think this way, then you have a mental bucket for where to put database constraints that is broader than just db constraints but includes preconditions on methods and stored procedures etc&#8230;</p>
