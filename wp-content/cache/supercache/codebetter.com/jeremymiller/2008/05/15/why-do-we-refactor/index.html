<ol>
<li>Experimentation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m purposely revisiting some code just to see if I can come up with a better solution and structure.
<li>Improving the structural quality of the code in order to make the code more approachable to others.
<li>Some of the code is flat out embarrassing.
<li>Changing the structure to allow for easier extensions.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a couple specific new pieces of functionality that I thought would be easier to implement if I did some refactoring first.
<li>To more closely align the architecture with its functionality and usage.&nbsp; StructureMap was originally envisioned as a generic mechanism to build an object graph from some sort of Xml representation.&nbsp; Today, we do vastly more things with an IoC tool than I had in mind back in the summer of 2003.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the effort proceeds, I&#8217;ve been thinking about the reasons that we do refactoring, or more importantly, the reasons that justify refactoring.&nbsp; When the topic of refactoring as a described practice was first being broached earlier in this decade, I read a lot of people upset over the idea of refactoring.&nbsp; Refactoring was variously described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A result of insufficient upfront design (which I still think is silly because refactoring is often a result of doing upfront design too early and/or getting that upfront design wrong)
<li>Undisciplined hacking
<li>A dangerous activity that needlessly&nbsp;risked destabilizing working code (a very real fear that can nevertheless be mitigated by good automated test coverage&nbsp;with well written code and well written tests)
<li>A waste of resources.&nbsp; Useless goldplating, or as my buddy <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/">Chad Myers</a> would say, &#8220;polishing the nosecone.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, what are the responsible reasons that lead us to refactor our code?&nbsp; I can think of two major reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>To remedy a deficiency in code, design, or architectural quality.</li>
<ol>
<li>We shouldn&#8217;t declare a coding task complete until it reaches&nbsp;the quality demanded by the team.&nbsp; These refactoring&#8217;s are generally small, cheap items like renaming methods and extracting methods that can be performed safely and quickly with an automated tool.
<li>I&#8217;m doing a lot of work on StructureMap as a result of static analysis results from <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">NDepend</a>.&nbsp; NDepend helpfully pointed out some flaws in the class structure that I&#8217;ve since remedied.&nbsp; In specific, I&#8217;ve been working on reducing the complexity of any class with a high Cyclomatic Complexity (all the classes are now under 30 with a few exceptions that I&#8217;m ignoring because the methods are all simple).&nbsp; I would also worry about efferent and afferent coupling plus the size of&nbsp;the classes and methods&nbsp;in your system.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>To make a forthcoming change to the code easier.&nbsp; </li>
<ol>
<li>If I&#8217;m changing a big method or complex class I&#8217;ll often start by refactoring towards a <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/12/03/Composed-Method-Pattern.aspx">Composed Method</a> by extracting methods or even smaller, more focused classes.&nbsp; On a project last year I did some quick renaming of variables from &#8220;m0, m1, m3&#8243; to more descriptive names.&nbsp; My goal in these cases is to simply make the existing code easier to understand *before* I start to make modifications.
<li>For a new feature, I might need part of the functionality of&nbsp;an existing&nbsp;method or a class, but not the rest of it.&nbsp; Rather than duplicate that functionality by copying and pasting, I&#8217;ll extract the functionality to be shared into a new class or method so that it can be easily reused by the code for the new feature.
<li>In several cases, I&#8217;ve wanted to change&nbsp;one aspect of the&nbsp;behavior of an existing class while leaving the rest of the class&#8217;s behavior intact.&nbsp; In that case, I think the class is violating the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SingleResponsibilityPrinciple">Single Responsibility Principle</a>, and I&#8217;ve split the class up along responsibility lines to isolate the changes to a smaller surface area.&nbsp;
<li>Before making a change, you may need to decrease or even eliminate coupling on an existing code structure.&nbsp; In StructureMap, I&#8217;ve frequently found myself wanting to change the internal structure of a class for various reasons, but first being blocked because other classes are coupled to internal details of the existing code structure.&nbsp; In many cases, the culprit has been a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> violation.&nbsp;
<li>Introducing new abstractions often gives us a new seam in the class structure that we can exploit to add new behavior with minimal change to existing classes
<li>If we have to change any functionality that has duplicated representations in the code, it&#8217;s often worth the while to first&nbsp;refactor the code to eliminate that duplication before making the change.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, you&#8217;re main goal with refactoring is to make the code easier to work with in the future.&nbsp; In some cases (the second category), that desired change is immediate.&nbsp; In the first category, you&#8217;re simply keeping the code cleaner to handle any type of extension and make the system easier to understand.&nbsp; In regards to Lean thinking, you only refactor on a project when the proposed refactoring will lead to better throughput of the development work.&nbsp; If a structural problem in the code isn&#8217;t causing any immediate harm or friction, you probably leave it alone for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?&nbsp; What did I miss?</p>

<p>refactoring is a great thing, I typically spend designated time to stop rolling the code and step back and refactor.  </p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-4011" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I often refactor as a function of scale.  When enough new features have been added the code starts wafting this stench that code is being duplicated.  In a toss away app this isn&#8217;t too much of an issue but anything that&#8217;s going to require maintenance by others needs to be refactored as a sanity check.  Nothing worse than thinking you&#8217;ve fixed an issue only to find the exact same code somewhere else tripping you up.</p>
<p>The other reason I&#8217;ll refactor is it gives me a chance to put my current problem into my subconscious for a bit of stewing.  With good source control and tests refactoring is rarely that strenuous nor does it require the same brainwork that figuring out a new feature does so it gives me a break while still doing something useful.</p>

<p>What if I want the PluginCollection returned by PluginFamily.Plugins {get;} to die?  It&#8217;s arguably just a detail of PluginFamily, so I should be able to do that, except there&#8217;s a hundred other classes that &#8220;know&#8221; about the Plugins property.

<p>With VS2008 we do not have any more reasons not to write small methods, we have the refacor tool one right-click away.  It does everything for us.  VS could warn us (with warnings for example) that a method exceeds some cyclomatic complexity threshold.</p>
<p>One other aspect I think we refactoring is testability.  If I have code that has some goal but I have no way of testing it easily, it is a refactor case.  Sometimes just putting the code in the right place solves the thing.</p>
<p>I think tools will help us identify rapidly what  are the weak spots in our code.</p>
