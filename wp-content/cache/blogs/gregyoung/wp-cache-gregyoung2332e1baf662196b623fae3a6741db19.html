This series of posts will look at the editor and various tweaks and addons that are needed to get working with C# code. There are tons of tutorials about sublime online but none seem to cover setting up a C# environment. To start with let&#8217;s learn how to be able to compile code.</p>
<p>Go to tools-&gt;build-&gt;new build. A file will open. Drop in:</p>
<p>{<br />
	&#8220;cmd&#8221;: ["xbuild"],<br />
	&#8220;path&#8221;: &#8220;/opt/mono/bin/&#8221;,<br />
	&#8220;working_dir&#8221;: &#8220;${project_path:${folder}}&#8221;,<br />
	&#8220;file_regex&#8221;: &#8220;^  (.*)\\(([0-9]*),([0-9]*)&#8221;<br />
}</p>
<p>Then save this file named xbuild.</p>
<p>Note I run mono trunk built from source which is why my prefix is /opt/mono. Now when you have a folder open for your project it will run xbuild in the root of that folder. This only works if there is only a single solution in the root folder. To build use ctrl+b or f7.</p>
<p>In the next post we will look at switching between code and basic navigation.</p>

<p>CQRS can be called an architectural pattern. Just like Transaction Script is an architectural pattern. Event Sourcing is also an architectural pattern (it is also not an architecture or an architectural style).</p>
<p>CQRS and Event Sourcing are not architectural styles. Service Oriented Architecture, Event Driven Architecture are examples of architectural styles. They describe a system of systems (or a system of many components depending on how you express things). CQRS and Event Sourcing describe something inside a single system or component. </p>
<p>This is very important to understand most architectural patterns are not good to apply everywhere. If you see architectural patterns in an architectural guideline you probably have a problem (if you see an architectural style in a guideline its much safer). EG: To say &#8220;all components must use active record&#8221; = bad. To say &#8220;integration between components must be async and done through events&#8221; = no so bad. The largest failure I see from people using event sourcing is that they try to use it everywhere.</p>
<p>There is only one architecture. It is the one of the system you are talking about. It is its own set of trade offs and decisions that have been made. It is how <strong>it</strong> works.</p>
<p>When we talk about your architecture you could have SOA+EDA with ActiveRecord+CRUD in some places and Event Sourcing in others. Your system is unique, you system has its own architecture.</p>

There were many great presentations on building up better processes and a particularly interesting one by Linda Rising on the introduction of agile into organizations. However in talking with many of the people during breaks and dinners etc especially attendees I noticed different problems that people were having in real life.</p>
<p><strong>The had the wrong people</strong></p>
<p>No amount of process will fix this problem. If I take a bunch of people that don&#8217;t know how to actually produce decent code that works my process won&#8217;t fix it. They can&#8217;t actually build the wrong thing let alone the right thing if they can figure it out. I might be able to get away with teaching them to actually produce but now I have bigger issues. Can you imagine if you had to teach your mechanic how to change your oil so that he could actually change yours? </p>
<p>Its feasible to train such a team but it will be very expensive and time consuming, this should only be done in the worst case where other options are politically unavailable for some reasons (yes government sector I&#8217;m looking at you)</p>
<p>If a team is unable to produce instead of attempting to introduce small incremental changes. Consider making really big changes (like getting rid of a large portion of the team). </p>
<p>I think we should really at conferences be spending more time talking about big changes and how to know when to use them. We should also spend more time talking about <strong>how to build a team of the right people</strong>. I know this is not as interesting of a topic but it seems there are many more people with this issue than those in cases where they have a well executing team that they want to improve.</p>

<p>From the second page of the paper (what most people consider as waterfall).</p>
<p><img src="http://gregfyoung.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screen-shot-2012-08-01-at-11-55-14-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2012 08 01 at 11 55 14 AM" border="0" width="600" height="378" /></p>
<p>Now Royce has the following to say about this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in this concept, but the implementation described above is risky and invites failure. The problem is illustrated in Figure 4. The testing phase which occurs at the end of the development cycle is the first event for  which timing, storage, input/output transfers, etc., are experienced as distinguished from analyzed. These phenomena are not precisely analyzable. They are not the solutions to the standard partial differential equations of mathematical physics for instance. Yet if these phenomena fail to satisfy the various external constraints, then invariably a major redesign is required. A simple octal patch or redo of some isolated code will not fix these kinds of difficulties. The required design changes are likely to be so disruptive that the software requirements upon which the design is based and which provides the rationale for everything are violated. Either the requirements must be modified, or a substantial change in the design is required. In effect the development process has returned to the origin and one can expect up to a lO0-percent overrun in schedule and/or costs.</p>
<p>Sounds a lot like the arguments people make against waterfall right?</p>
<p>Now I may disagree with some of the assessments made by Royce (importance of documentation being one) but the irony of associating the chart above to him never misses me. Read the paper, waterfall as presented by most people is a strawman http://leadinganswers.typepad.com/leading_answers/files/original_waterfall_paper_winston_royce.pdf</p>

<p>I chose to teach this class in Vilnius as I live here and there is not a whole lot of educational opportunities available. A side benefit as that being is eastern europe expenses are much lower than western europe which is shown in the price (there is also a promo code for eastern europeans).</p>

This is not a decision that is being take lightly and much thought has gone into it. This post is to explain why we went free and the future.</p>
<p>Almost two years ago now sitting in the Dubliner in Oslo we started having a discussion with Einar about AutoTest.Net. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if AutoTest.Net could only run the tests that needed to be run when a piece of code changed. We looked in the market and there was no software that could do it well (we only actually found one named infinitest in the java space and it was at the time (I have not tried it lately) very easy to trick).</p>
<p>We discussed with quite a few people the idea and were continually told that &#8220;its impossible&#8221;. We like &#8220;impossible problems&#8221;. After some quick spikes we even discussed it as being &#8220;non trivial but not hard&#8221; we figured a prototype could be working in about a month (given the usual software +-50% &#8220;fluff&#8221;). <em>I love that now its no longer considered impossible but an expected behaviour of such tools</em></p>
<p>I returned to Montreal and started working on the bit that did the selection, it was dubbed the &#8220;minimizer&#8221; and worked off of static analysis (we realized very early on that code coverage is not a good solution to the problem of which tests to run as it describes the last run which may or may not have anything to do with the current run). After one month there was a prototype there, unfortunately it ran way too many tests. Often it would produce results of 200 tests when you really would expect 8 to run. After another 4-6 months of work it started to give pretty reasonable results in most situations. Sounds like a classical software estimation process to me <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>But enough reminiscing …</p>
<p><strong>Mighty Moose is from this point forward free</strong>. Not &#8220;free in beta&#8221; or &#8220;free with a bunch of functionality turned off&#8221; but free (license is being updated as I write this). We announced this rather quietly at NDC.</p>
<p>Many people have asked me &#8220;why would you go free? you could charge for what you have.&#8221;. This is true. Continuous Testing tools will be taking off and yes we could charge for it however its not quite as simple as that.</p>
<p>To start with support is generally included with a paid product such as a dev tool. Let&#8217;s try some really quick math. Let&#8217;s say we were wildly successful the first year and got 2000 paying daily users (this would mean we would likely have at minimum double this actual users as you often give away free versions to user groups etc). This would suggest we have very deep penetration into the .NET TDD community (how many TDD&#8217;ers do you think there actually are?)</p>
<p>So 4000 users. What could we possibly charge for such a tool? USD$250 would seem to be about the average pricing our research suggested. So we would in the first year have a top line revenue of $500k USD. That sounds like a lot but lets start breaking that down further. For 4000 users how many dedicated support guys would be needed? </p>
<p>One interesting thing I have found is that very often a tool such as Mighty Moose (or any continuous testing tool) is the messenger of a problem not really the problem itself. This could be versioning issues with mSpec (I believe this is fixed now), never having run a redirected build before (this needs to be done as VS loves to lock files), or even just a new release of the CLR/Unit Testing Framework/etc. If you were to look at the width of support of a continuous testing tool its build automation + unit test running + profiler/analysis. This is very wide considering the price of the tool. </p>
<p>Along with this as dev tools are built to be very flexible quite often you will need to do some level of configuration on an existing project in order to get things working properly (out of box can only go so far .. even if it works you likely need to optimize things). It is not hard to trick any such tools. Just put a post build step that manipulates your output e.g.: moves files around (every such post build step would need custom integration written to understand it).</p>
<p>Even worse the support guys you have need to not only be developers but be good developers. In other words the role is basically 50% support 50% developing new features (dev team does support). You could try with just regular support guys and front line vs second line support but this will probably just annoy many users though it could possibly lower blended cost of support (e.g. front line + dev team). These methodologies however also annoys your developers as they are now doing direct support. </p>
<p>In order to get around the support cost question you are left with three possible options. The first is a no go from the start, support contracts. Developers don&#8217;t want to pay yearly fees on support costs. The second is to reach high levels of growth but an issue here is how many people actually write tests (let alone do TDD) in .NET. This brings the third model that most developer tool vendors use, I release a new major version of the software once per year. </p>
<p>This &#8220;major version release&#8221; strategy basically allows people to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to the newest version. Generally I also will sunset support with this model to force upgrades (or at least lower support costs for older users). This model has been quite successful for many companies but comes with its own drawbacks. The largest drawback is that I as a company need to release a version of software whether or not I can come up with things that are really of value to my customers. Often I will end up with a few really valuable things but just listing those is not enough to get people to upgrade (think about a change log with 7 items on it…) so I start piling in crap to make a more impressive change log. This crap comes at a cost to the 80% of my users that don&#8217;t care about the particular feature and I end up building &#8220;mega tool&#8221;. This pattern can be seen over and over again whether we talk about Visual Studio itself, Microsoft Word, or any of the popular VS adding products.</p>
<p>This actually leads to a second issue as well. When in beta we have focused very heavily on features that only really interest the top 5% of developers (not a good base for a product, for a product we would be much more interested in the early/late majority areas of the s-curve). One question we get quite often is &#8220;how well will things work on my solution with 300 projects&#8221;. Now that we have said that we are free I can honestly tell you &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, when you have a solution with 300 projects in it you have bigger problems to worry about than getting continuous testing working&#8221;. Flashy new tools are not the answer, you should stop trying to hide your pain and start doing root cause analysis. </p>
<p>If we were to go down the lines of a paid product we would basically be forced to stop innovating. Our business goals would not be well aligned with our personal goals of changing the way people code. Our bread and butter would be the early/late majorities who want to use things in a much different way (they want slow incremental change) than the early adopters and on much different looking code bases. An example of this can be seen in a common feature request in our graphs of &#8220;making them look better and come up faster when there are more than 1000 nodes to show&#8221; (they come up with very small nodes). Yes we can do this (and spend 3 months of developer time working on it) but I am entering a point of alleviating pain instead of dealing with the underlying symptom (how on earth do you understand code that puts 1000 nodes in a graph, the graph will not solve this issue for you). This is also 3 months of developer time that we were not working on something actually useful. </p>
<p><strong><em>I personally believe that the future is not in making tools that alleviate pain that many have but in helping them identify root causes of the pain and resolving it.</em></strong></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2012/05/31/situational-leadership-and-coaching-2/"><![CDATA[<p>Much of the content of this post comes from my girlfriend&#8217;s masters thesis on the subject though it is quite relevant to our industry as we seem to use many words wrong and have some misguided ideas.</p>
<p>Many people talk about coaching within teams. Hell you can go just about anywhere to find an &#8220;agile coach&#8221;. We might for instance want to go to the http://www.agilecoach.net/. We <strong>LOVE</strong> coaching in our industry. However coaching is just one tool amongst many in our belt and is actually non-effective at times. </p>
<p>At a talk recently I heard that we should always be coaching within our teams. This is likely as we will see to not work well. <strong>We overuse coaching</strong>.</p>
<p>Situational Leadership defines four learning mechanisms.</p>
<p>Direction: where a learner is given tasks and direction<br />
Coaching: where the learner is doing the task<br />
Supporting: where the learner is doing the task but lacks confidence<br />
Delegating: where the learner is no longer a learner but is actually doing the task</p>
<p>We have a tendency of applying &#8220;coaching&#8221; all the way through the process. The research is looking more so at when coaching should be applied. As an example its quite common for a team to want to go to agile so they will hire an &#8220;agile coach&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Highly Directive/Low Supportive</p>
<p>Situational Leadership would specify that when a learner is new to a task, coaching in ineffectual. Instead we should be giving direction to the learner without being highly supportive.</p>
<p>When I was quite young I worked cleaning cars. My first day on the job my boss did not sit with me and show me the best ways of cleaning a tire. He did not talk to me about the theory associated with rims verse hub caps. He just told me to &#8220;do it this way&#8221;. He gave direction.</p>
<p>Learners who are new to a subject are not good candidates for coaching. They need direction and to reach of a level of understanding before coaching will be effective for them.</p>
<p><em>no he was not Mr Miyagi though Mr Miyagi was very directive.</em></p>
<h2>Coaching</h2>
<p>Highly Directive/Highly Supportive</p>
<p>Coaching would be the next step after a learner has reached a certain level of maturity in understanding. A classic example of where coaching would apply would be after a learner has for instance taken a class on a subject.</p>
<p>Years ago I took a class on how to build and deliver presentations. Oddly at the end of that class (which was mostly directive) I found that giving real presentations is well slightly different. Talking to a room full of people about a real subject is different than doing it in class. I am sure many people that have taken classes (even mine) can relate to this feeling.</p>
<p>I began videotaping my presentation and I had someone who was very good at presenting look over them with me, give me feedback (positive and negative). They also even would sometimes go through with me doing dry runs of the presentation. They were coaching me. I was defining and doing the work, they were helping to guide me and providing feedback.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Low Directive/Highly Supportive</p>
<p>The next level would be a supporting role. It would be a move away from providing feedback (constructive criticism) and moving more towards a supporting role.</p>
<p>Over time I learned better how to present to an audience. Admittedly I still lacked confidence in my own decision making. My mentor slowly stopped giving me direct assistance and feedback and became more so a supporting role. They would help me in having the confidence that I did actually know what I was doing. Sometimes a rightly placed &#8220;at a boy&#8221; can make a world of difference.</p>
<p>This brings us to the last stage.</p>
<h2>Delegation</h2>
<p>Low Directive/Low Supportive</p>
<p>This is the last step in the process (the ending of the learning). This is the teacher pulling away from a now fully competent no longer student.</p>
<p>Care must be had as well as many leaders have a hard time pulling away from the supporting role and allowing the student/learner to flourish on their own. This is generally considered the end point of a successful learning process. </p>
<p><em>The &#8220;levels&#8221; actually flow into one another as well. Its not that one day you stop getting direction and start getting support etc its that you get less of one or more of the other.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://gregfyoung.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/picture_blanchard_situational_leadership.gif" alt="Picture blanchard situational leadership" border="0" width="331" height="541" /></p>
<p>When we discuss &#8220;coaching&#8221; we generally discuss this whole process. This is not correct and understanding the differences in situations can be very valuable in successful learning. I can&#8217;t claim to be an expert but this was very interesting stuff personally to learn about.</p>
<p>Again this is based on my girlfriend&#8217;s research for her masters thesis (I got to help quite a bit and learned a lot in educational theory, maybe I am ready for coaching now!). I have been trying to convince her to do a talk at one of our conferences on the subject (this is 1-2 pages, her paper was 70!). If this is interesting to you please drop her a comment of encouragement here!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2012/04/24/state-machines-and-business-users-2/"><![CDATA[<p>I was at a workshop over the weekend talking about the use of Finite State Machines as coordination mechanisms for systems. These things might be called sagas, activities, workflows, process managers (my preferred term lately from PEI), orchestrations, choreographers, and I am sure I am leaving out a few.</p>
<p>One of the guys in the talk (quite knowledgable) brought up that they used to use petri nets for this as well as pure finite state machines and there had been a push to more procedural mechanisms as business users don&#8217;t think in terms of finite state machines. I noted that while we have been moving to more procedural methods, as most of these procedural methods are in their hearts asynchronous our procedural techniques tend to be domain specific languages that internally generate state machines anyways, often based in the join calculus (think futures or the async keyword in C# when joining).</p>
<p>However later in the day I had a realization connecting two things. We like to describe business situations in gherkin style (not strict) specifications.</p>
<p>Given: Some initial starting point<br />
When: Something happens<br />
Then: Something occurred</p>
<p>We as an industry have been very successful getting specifications written in this style. We regularly do analysis and write acceptance criteria using this style. Business users seem to have been fairly capable of understanding it.</p>
<p>This style is basically describing a state machine. </p>
<p>Given: some initial state<br />
When: a stimulus<br />
Then: Something occurred (message/transition depending on style of testing)</p>
<p>How can we be so successful with this style of specification and in the next breath say that business users can&#8217;t understand state machines? The trick is they don&#8217;t understand the actual machine but they understand (and can specify very well) the exterior behaviours of such a machine.</p>
<p>Try getting a business user to create for you the state machine to control a simple DVD player for you. Likely they will scratch their heads and politely become very busy so they won&#8217;t be able to attend the next meeting. Try getting them to specify </p>
<p>Given a video is playing<br />
When fast forward is pressed<br />
Then the play goes at double speed</p>
<p>Maybe the problem here that caused our move towards procedural style controllers was the goal all the middleware seems to push of having business users <strong>writing</strong> the activities as opposed to reading about/specifying/understanding them. I have yet to see in all the organizations I have been to a single one where the dream of having business users creating these types of long running procedures actually panned out. <em>to be fair: I have seen it work but the business user had formerly been a developer and BA</em></p>
