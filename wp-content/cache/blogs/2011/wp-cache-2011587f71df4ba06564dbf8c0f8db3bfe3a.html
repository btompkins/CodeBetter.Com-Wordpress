		<description>Standings after Sunday - Ngruman	106
i_am_unni	98
AdamMills	96Sunday&#039;s games are in the books and a Codebetter.com Fantasy Football leader has emerged. Ngruman is well out in front with 106 points, followed by i_am_unni with 98 and AdamMills with 96. But this thing isn&#039;t over yet. With one more game to play, a few contenders are still trying to work their way to the top.

Taco, currently in 13th place with 85 points, has the best chance of taking the prize from Ngruman. If Rams running back, Cadillac Williams, can score 22 fantasy points, Taco is going to take the prize.

James Hollingworth also has a shot. He&#039;s sitting in 26th place with 74 points. If the Giant&#039;s running back, Ahmad Bradshaw, can earn 33 points (more than any other NFL player this week), James will grab the top spot.Also in contention - 38th - Patrick - 69 pts - Sam Bradford, StL QB - 38 to win39th - Bill Groesbeck - 69 pts - Mike Sims-Walker, StL - 38 to win75th - Jesse Hansen - 60 pts - Mario Manningham, NYG - 47 to win</description>

		<description>Don&#039;t be confused! You have a fantasy football team. According to the spreadsheet, your team has the following players -

Matt Cassel, KC
Ray Rice, Bal
Tim Hightower, Wsh
Brandon Marshall, Mia
Roddy White, Atl

So you have a stake in the following games -

Kansas City Chiefs @ Detroit Lions - 1 PM EST
Baltimore Ravens @ Tennessee Titans - 1 PM EST
Arizona Cardinals @ Washington Redskins - 1 PM EST
Houston Texans @ Miami Dolphins - 4:15 PM EST
Philadelphia Eagles @ Atlanta Falcons - 8:20 PM EST

If you see those games on TV or the internet, listen or watch for your guy&#039;s name. The more good things he does means a better chance for you to win!</description>
