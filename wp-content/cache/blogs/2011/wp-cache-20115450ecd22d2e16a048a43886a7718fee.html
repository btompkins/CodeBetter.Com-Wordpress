		<description>I&#039;m getting pretty excited for the Windows 8 tablet in general. Being able to bring Windows with me without having to carry a laptop around everywhere and still be able to do many features my laptop can sounds brilliant. It sounds especially exciting as someone who is doing games development at uni and will be working on a personal game project this year. The game project would work perfectly on a touch screen as well as with a keyboard &amp;  mouse and it was originally planned for iOS before I decided to develop for Windows first and see where things go.

Loving the look of this content, hopefully not too late to enter but even if I am then my comment still stands. If I can&#039;t get a hold of a developer tablet then I&#039;ll wait for the Windows 8 tablet to be released officially and try saving up for one. There&#039;s been quite a few people thinking that the Windows 8 tablet won&#039;t make a difference but if it&#039;s marketed right then I think it could be huge.</description>

		<description>That is interesting and I can see how that might play out that way as a high ranked team has to perform at a high level where a low ranked team would be able to perform a little better but result in a better percentage.  As for multiple winners, weren&#039;t there multiple people with the same score last time?  Was it lucky to only have 1 with top score?  Do you have a tie breaker strategy?  Anyway, just suggestions.  I really love that you and Brendon are doing tese contests and of course do it how you think best so don&#039;t take it as a critisism.</description>

		<description>With one game left tonight, the field of 271 has narrowed to 3. Brian Kavanaugh is in the lead with 101 points, his final score for the week. Mike Graf and Thedric Walker are close behind with 99 and 95 points respectively; both have players in tonight&#039;s game. The projections favor Thedric Walker, but it&#039;s definitely going to be close.</description>

		<description>Hey Eric. I&#039;m working on this contest with Brendan. This is an interesting suggestion. I crunched the numbers on last week&#039;s results - here is what I found. We would have had the same winner and 4 out of the top 5 would have remained in the top 5. If anything, having a high projected score seems to be a curse. Of the projected top 10, only two of them ended up in actual top 10 and three of them weren&#039;t even in the top 50. Conversely, 1st, 4th, and 7th place were projected to be 42nd, 146th, and 166th out of 195.</description>

		<description>Hey great contests Brendon.   I was wondering though if you might consider a different scoring system to level the chances.  Instead of raw points, do the result - projected and use percentage as a secondary qualifier.  So a team with a projected score of 90 and result of 99 would be 9 points with a +10% percentage and a team with a projected score of 60 and result of 70 would be 10 points with a +16.7% percentage and would end up higher ranked.  The teams with low projected points would have to have big weeks to have a shot otherwise.  But maybe you consider the team draft a first round of randomness.
