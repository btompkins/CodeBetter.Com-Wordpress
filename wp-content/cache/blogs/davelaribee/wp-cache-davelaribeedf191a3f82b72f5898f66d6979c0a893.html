			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The time has come (some would say long passed) for me to leave CodeBetter. I&#8217;m feeling the itch to do my own thing and I think there&#8217;s a lot of&nbsp;talented&nbsp;and outspoken developers out there who can better benefit from the massive reach CodeBetter brings. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been quite an honor to be associated with the fine folks here and I look forward to reading awesome technical content going forward. To say I&#8217;m completely ditching is a bit of a stretch; I&#8217;ll be lurking on the CodeBetter back channel giving all kinds of unsolicited and cranky advice and even guest blogging&nbsp;as a &#8220;CodeBetter Alumn&#8221;&nbsp;when I have something developer-esque to get off my chest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I haven&#8217;t stopped blogging! In fact, I have renewed motivation for writing and am picking back up at my old site,&nbsp;<a href="http://laribee.com/">http://laribee.com/</a>. If you want to keep receiving my stuff, you can subscribe at <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/thebeelog/">http://feeds.feedburner.com/thebeelog/</a>. You can expect most of my content going forward to be about the design, planning, process and coaching aspects of software development.</p>
<p>So, yeah&#8230; thanks, everybody! Now back to your regularly scheduled program.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard statistics about the &#8220;high cost of losing a customer.&#8221; The theory is simple and true (fact?): keeping existing customers and repeat business is much more profitable than attracting new customers. Here are a few facts from <a href="http://www.businesscoach.com/go/bc/handouts/the_high_cost_of_losing_a_customer/index.cfm">BusinessCoach.com</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- For every customer who bothers to complain, there are 26 others who remain silent.<br />
- The average &ldquo;wronged&rdquo; customer will tell 8 to 16 people.<br />
- 91% of unhappy customers will never purchase services from you again.<br />
- It costs about five times as much to attract a new customer as it costs to keep an old one.<br />
- Each one of your customers has a circle of influence of 250 people or potential customers who hear bad things about you!
</p></blockquote>
<p>The point of this post is simple: <b>RETAIN YOUR GOOD DEVELOPERS.</b> Getting someone up to speed on a legacy codebase takes a long time and is an expensive undertaking. A large part of the software coach&#8217;s or manager&#8217;s job is attracting, developing and <i>keeping</i> talent. And that talent becomes more valuable over time. </p>
<p>Yes, you might be able to replace someone at a lower annual salary, but you have to take into account the complexity of your code portfolio in how long it&#8217;ll take to make that person productive. A $60K/annum employee may very well take $120K before reaching the productivity level and contribution of the developer who left the team.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely nothing. Or so the story goes&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a mini-exchange with my pal <a href="/blogs/glenn.block/Default.aspx">Glenn Block</a> last night on Twitter. He was recycling the somewhat old meme that code coverage is a cockamamie metric that, as he puts it, &#8221; a false security blanket on quality&#8221;. </p>
<p>Measurements (other than net profit, of course) are merely indicators. They give us insight into what we&#8217;re doing, red flags that help us know when to follow up on and drill into with more qualitative and hands on tools.This is, more-or-less, the idea behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomation">Autonomation or &#8220;automation with a human touch.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>For example: while code coverage isn&#8217;t proof that our testing efforts will yield higher maintainability, it does tell us a teams commitment to a test practice.</p>
<p>I tend to believe the most interesting indicators are composite metrics. What happens when we start thinking about combining code coverage with cyclomatic complexity? I&#8217;d like to read a (hopefully) inverse relationship over time, coverage rising while complexity falls, as a good indicator that we&#8217;re doing simple design.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember about metrics is they are only single purpose tools which, correctly applied, gift us with little tidbits of insight. It&#8217;s up to you to find meaningful and creative uses for the various metrics and their various combinations. Once you start doing that, measurements like code coverage can certainly help you achieve your immediate goals.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m completely obsessed with the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-technology">low-technology</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term low-technology is a description of those crafts and tools whose inception (typically) predates the Industrial Revolution.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A test for low-technology may be that it can be practiced or fabricated with a minimum of Capital investment by an individual or small group of individuals; and that the knowledge of the practice can be completely comprehended by a single individual, free from increasing specialization and compartmentalization.</p></blockquote>
<p>An excellent overview of some of the cutting edge efforts in low-technologies can be seen in this <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_smith_shares_simple_lifesaving_design.html">TED video with low-technologist Amy Smith</a>. I completely agree with when says, &#8220;not all inventions need to be grandiose, complex things&#8230; sometimes they can be simple and smart ideas that just help a lot of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second block quote is where I&#8217;m coming from. What are those tools in software development that add lots of value without minimal getting started overhead. Pair-programming seems like an excellent example of low technology. Emergent design, test-driven development and value-driven approaches like XP are yet more.</p>
<p>It seems, to me anyway, that these are the things that&#8217;ll yield the most benefits. Both vendor-supplied tooling and trending topics we hold near and dear, like <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain-Driven Design</a> and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DSLs</a> and this fluent madness in general, strike me as more <i>high-technology</i> approaches.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with high-technology, of course, but my instinct is that the risk-reward equation for most teams usually favors low-technology. We have, after all, limited bandwidth and attention, so my vote will ever go to what I see as big and easy wins: stuff focused on beefing up the signal of our communication as a team and community against the noise we might get as a software fashion victim.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a key topic I&#8217;ll be centering on over the next little while and thought y&#8217;all might find this way of looking at our kit, our standard tradecraft at least a little bit interesting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most productive and useful programming language you know, by a long shot, is English or Hindi or Portuguese or Spanish or French or whatever human language your team uses. Good communication skills are way more valuable to you and your customers than picking up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">a new language every year</a>. That is, while there is value in the item on<br />
the right, I value the item on the left more. <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Sound familiar?</a></p>
<p>Developers that name things well and program with a respect for human<br />
languages create more maintainable and easier to follow code. Being able to communicate with a customer, analyst and/or product owner can save you hour upon hour of effort and keep your solution simple. No programming language no matter how syntactically minimal or internal DSL friendly can ever come close to this.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>UPDATE: The workshop is scheduled for December 2-3.</b></p>
<p>A little housekeeping. I&#8217;m doing a two-day workshop I&#8217;m doing in London in December (1-2).</p>
<p><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/design-architecture/towards-a-new-architect" target="_blank">http://skillsmatter.com/course/design-architecture/towards-a-new-architect</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll share the experiences and tools I&#8217;ve developed as a team<br />
lead over the last decade doing architecture on Agile then Lean teams.<br />
My thesis should sound familiar: we need a Chief Architect-like role in<br />
development, someone who considers all aspects of the system and can<br />
coach the team toward emergent design in product and process. The<br />
workshop is aimed at giving you actionable tools and an overview of<br />
things I&#8217;ve seen work really well together. Some of the<br />
Lean/Kanban-related topics include how XP works with Kanban and how<br />
architectural/design approaches can help get to release-per-feature and higher ROI for your business. </p>
<p>The course is appropriate for technical leads (current and<br />
aspiring), product owners and designers, coaches and senior developers or<br />
software architects. </p>
<p>Hope to see you there (and have pints with the London Kanban and AltNetBeers kids)!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I watched <a href="http://twitter.com/schambers">Sean Chambers</a> deliver an excellent talk about <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">S.O.L.I.D. principles</a> last weekend at <a href="http://www.tallycodecamp.org/2009">Tallahassee CodeCamp</a>. It motivated me to look a little deeper into the <a href="/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2008/09/22/why-solid-gimme-an-l.aspx">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>We accept this as a truth and it&#8217;s what makes us hate the <i>is </i>keyword in C# so damn much. I wrote a post a while back <a href="/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2008/09/22/why-solid-gimme-an-l.aspx">that explains (or attempts to) what LSP and why it&#8217;s important</a>, which is to say I won&#8217;t harp on the what and why here. I&#8217;ll spend your attention, rather, on how LSP works with exceptions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">LSP article on Wikipedia</a> provides clarification around exceptions and subclasses:</p>
<blockquote><p>No new exceptions should be thrown by methods of the subtype, except<br />
where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by<br />
the methods of the supertype. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a contrived and fugly example in ruby:</p>
<pre>class FileSystem<br />  <br />  def save(path, text)<br />    File.open(path, 'w+') {|f| f.write(text) }<br />  end<br />  <br />end<br /><br />class AmazonFileSystem &lt; FileSystem<br />  <br />  include 'amazon_library'<br />  <br />  def save(path, contents)<br />    begin<br />      write_to_s3(path, contents)<br />    rescue<br />      AmazonWebServicesError.new('cannot write file');<br />    end<br />  end<br />  <br />end<br /><br />class AmazonWebServicesError &lt; StandardError<br />  <br />  def initialize(message)<br />    @message = message<br />  end<br />  <br />  def message<br />    return @message<br />  end<br />  <br />end<br /><br />def backup_system<br />  <br />  file_name = 'book.txt';<br />  my_important_text = 'hello world';<br />  <br />  [AmazonFileSystem.new, FileSystem.new].each do |file_system|<br />    begin<br />      file_system.save(file_name)<br />    rescue AmazonFileError<br />      # VIOLATION! FOR SHAME!<br />    end<br />  end<br />  <br />end<br /></pre>
<p>A <i>try-catch</i> (or <i>begin-rescue</i>) is a conditional pattern and it&#8217;s my sense that when we use this with implementation inheritance we&#8217;ve made a particularly egregious and insidious violation of the LSP. </p>
<p>First off, we&#8217;re know things about the internals of our subclass in our consumer. We&#8217;ve broken encapsulation and increased coupling. </p>
<p>Secondly, our special AmazonWebServiceError only shares StandardError with what&#8217;s likely to be thrown by our FileSystem class. This means we can&#8217;t treat errors that are likely to fall out of Ruby&#8217;s IO core polymorphically. More conditional logic/branching, more cyclomatic complexity, more coupling, and these are bad things.</p>
<p>What can we do to stay on the good side of LSP when dealing with exceptions in inheritance hierarchies, you ask? Well, as the rule states, we can make exceptions subclass the exception the parent throws. For example, we could catch whatever error our fictitious amazon library throws and decorate it with a custom error that derives from the error File.write in ruby core throws. Another, perhaps, better option would be to hold off on coding defensively wherever you can and let the exception bubble up to a central part of your program that deals, exclusively, with these corner cases. That is, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480591.aspx">implement an exception shield</a> wherever we don&#8217;t need compensating logic.</p>
<p>LSP and exceptions: another thing to pay attention to while on programming&#8217;s happy trail, friends.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you listening? I&#8217;m about to give away the secret to to all of this this Lean/Agile/Software Craftsmanship fuss. The secret is&#8230; <a target="_self" title="Exercise &amp; Expect Discipline" href="http://laribee.com/blog/2007/08/09/exercise-and-expect-discipline/">DISCIPLINE</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The time is always right to do what is right&#8221; &#8212; Martin Luther King, Jr.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming we know what to do, and I know a lot of you reading this do, we should always just say no to shortcuts. Delivery pressure is a real thing, but if you&#8217;re estimating a piece of work, estimate what it&#8217;ll take to do the right thing. If real Object-Oriented Programming is new to you, it&#8217;s going to take you a whole lot longer to get something done. If the language is new to you, it&#8217;s going to take you a lot longer to get something done.</p>
<p>Sometimes we take embarrassing and unprofessional shortcuts like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting out of TDD mode.</li>
<li>Rolling shoddy spike code into production.</li>
<li>Using an older, more familiar but less quality recipe to a common coding task.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best way I know of to keep discipline up is pair programming. Some would say pairing is the way because two heads are better than one. I say it&#8217;s a great practice because it creates a healthy peer pressure.</p>
<p>Learning and discipline are the two halves of continuous improvement. In short: live what you learn, act on your new knowledge and skill.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you call a query method that returns true or false, I<br />
highly suggest that you make true results trip conditional logic /<br />
guard clauses / etc. I was driving out some code today in an MVC controller that had a dependency on an type who&#8217;s responsibility it is to check for unique email addresses in a database of user which looks like so:</p>
<pre>public interface IUniqueEmailValidator<br />{<br />  bool EmailAddressIsUnique(string email);<br />}<br /></pre>
<p>All well and good, but you&#8217;ll notice that the method returns <i>true</i> in the happy path. That is, if an email address is unique (working on an authentication system), the object returns true.</p>
<p>I use an auto-mocking container when doing TDD with .NET. Most implementations give you back a so-called dynamic mock which just absorbs calls and returns default values on methods that return value types. So in the case above, a dynamic mock will always return false unless you tell it otherwise. I&#8217;d end up having to put noisy stub code in all of my other specs. For example:</p>
<pre>Dependency()<br />  .Stub(u =&gt; u.EmailAddressIsUnique(null))<br />  .IgnoreArguments()<br />  .Return(true);<br /></pre>
<p>In the controller we&#8217;re working on right now, there are about 10 specifications that failed because of this default behavior. This is a big problem because the introduction of a new specification results in me having to change a bunch of other contexts which is stinky, fragile design!</p>
<p>An opportunity to make things better! I changed the interface to this:</p>
<pre>public interface IUniqueEmailValidator<br />{<br />  bool EmailAddressIsUnique(string email);<br />  bool EmailAddressIsTaken(string email);<br />}<br /></pre>
<p>The new <i>EmailAddressIsTaken</i> method simply inverts the result of <i>EmailAddressIsUnique</i>. Really frighteningly simple stuff, but, by calling the new method, my test code stays isolated and the special cases don&#8217;t break my numerous other specs.</p>
