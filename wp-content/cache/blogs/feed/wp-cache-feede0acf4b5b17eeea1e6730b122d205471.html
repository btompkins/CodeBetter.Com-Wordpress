			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Congratulations to our week 5 winner, Peter Johanson, with  83 Points!  He&#8217;ll be getting <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321751043">The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set, The, 3rd Edition</a>.</p>
<p>This week is another big one.  An EXOPC SLATE with the Windows 8 Developer Preview installed!</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright" src="http://www.exopc.com/images/exoslate.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="149" />The feature-rich EXOPC Slate gives you a full PC experience in tablet form. Its unique and user-friendly interface gives you easy access to apps, your favorite websites, your social networks, and anything else you want it to. All this on an 11.6-inch, multi-touch display that&#8217;s fun and easy to interact with.</p>
<p>• 2 GB of RAM allows for smooth multitasking among multiple programs and applications<br />
• 1.3-megapixel webcam keeps you in touch with friends, family, and colleagues<br />
• Mini-HDMI port lets you project high-def content onto your big-screen TV<br />
• Energy-efficient Intel Atom Pineview processor designed for longer battery life</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re changing up the rules for week 6 of  <a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/09/06/codebetter-com-wants-to-send-you-to-redmond/">CodeBetter Fantasy Football</a>.  If you’d like to play for this slate, you have to simply <strong>mention this post and @codebetter on twitter</strong>. We are going to weight your entry based on how many times your tweet is re-tweeted (we will get these counts through our Disqus comment system).  It&#8217;s totally fair to beg for re-tweets, the more the better.  Those players with the highest numbers of re-tweets will get the best teams (based on projected scores) going into the games this weekend. The remaining players will get teams randomly.  Clear as mud yet? <img src='http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  We will finalize the teams and post them here by 12PM EST on Sunday, October 23rd.   We will announce the winner by 5PM EST on Wednesday October 26th.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>Next week, we&#8217;re giving away attendance<strong> for three</strong> to <a href="http://www.devteach.com/Session.aspx">DevTeach Ottawa</a> November 2-4, 2011!   The rules will be a bit different this time :  We&#8217;re going to try to give away all three passes to the same person, so that you can take your friends or coworkers.  We want to make absolutely sure that every person that could possibly win a) can go, b) has a passport (if not from Canada), and c) can take two other people.  We&#8217;re going to provide the winner $600 to help offset travel and lodging costs.</p>
<p>So, if you think you can go, and use all three passes, reply/tweet/trackback this post, and you&#8217;re entered for next weeks drawing.    New teams will be generated, and the winner will be announced next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Congratulations to our week 2 winner, Mike Graf  with 109 points (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&amp;hl=en_US&amp;key=0ApfMNDGiGLqodGh1amN6R3BUQ3VVWldhSEFfeGFVZUE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=7&amp;output=html">see week 2 standings here</a>). He&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/productID.224518200/parentCategoryID.44066900/categoryID.54536100/list.true">getting this slate</a>!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to try to keep this going as long as we can get sponsors, and next week, we&#8217;ve lined up a fantastic prize from the folks at Addison-Wesley.  Five books from the Signature Series.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.informit.com/imprint/series_detail.aspx?ser=2629220">The Addison-Wesley Signature Series (Fowler)</a></p>
<p>Martin Fowler has been a pioneer of object technology in enterprise applications. His central concern is how to design software well. He focuses on getting to the heart of how to build enterprise software that will last well into the future. He is interested in looking behind the specifics of technologies to the patterns, practices, and principles that last for many years; these books should be usable a decade from now. Martin&#8217;s criterion is that these are books he wished he could write.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.informit.com/imprint/series_detail.aspx?ser=2393388">The Addison-Wesley Signature Series (Cohn)</a></p>
<p>Mike Cohn is the founder of <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software</a>, a process and project management consultancy and training firm. He is the author of <em>User Stories Applied for Agile Software Development</em> and <em>Agile Estimating and Planning</em>, as well as books on Java and C++ programming. With more than 20 years of experience, Mike has previously been a technology executive in companies of various sizes, from startup to Fortune 40. A frequent magazine contributor and conference speaker, Mike is a founding member of the AgileAlliance, and serves on its board of directors.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re including the following two books from the Fowler Series:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0132619369" target="_blank">Domain-Specific Languages</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0321601912" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery:</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And the following three books from Cohn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0321712471" target="_blank">Management 3.0:</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0321637704" target="_blank">Coaching Agile Teams</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0321579364" target="_blank">Succeeding with Agile</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/09/20/a-vslive-winner-next-week-win-a-windows-8-slate/">So, same deal as last time.</a>  If you&#8217;re already playing <a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/09/06/codebetter-com-wants-to-send-you-to-redmond/">CodeBetter Fantasy Football</a>, you&#8217;re still entered for next week.  If you&#8217;d like to play, just comment/trackback/tweet this post and you&#8217;ll be signed up for next week, and for the rest of the season. New teams will be generated for everyone, and we&#8217;ll announce the winner and hopefully a new contest next week!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>When we sat down to decide how to pick a winner for the <a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/09/06/codebetter-com-wants-to-send-you-to-redmond/">CodeBetter.Com wants to send you to Redmond!</a> contest, we realized we couldn&#8217;t just pick our winner out of a hat &#8211; it&#8217;s way too boring, and human choice generally exhibits poor statistical properties and pattern repetition.  What&#8217;s better, you might ask?  One word. <em>Fantasy Football</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>American football may not be your ball of yarn, so for the uninitiated: Fantasy football is about building and managing a virtual team of real-life NFL football players. These virtual teams score points based on the performance of real players in NFL games. For example, if New England Patriots quarterback, Tom Brady, is on your fantasy team, and he throws a touchdown in a real game, your fantasy team earns points; if he throws an interception, your team loses points.</p></blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">CodBetter.Com Fantasy Football</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">If you&#8217;ve entered <a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/09/06/codebetter-com-wants-to-send-you-to-redmond/">the contest</a> by 9AM EST tomorrow morning, you will be assigned a randomly generated fantasy football team.  That&#8217;s right, your very own team.  Each team has five players: one quarterback, one AFC running back, one NFC running back, one AFC wide receiver, and one NFC wide receiver. To create the pool of possible players, we used ESPN’s <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/tools/projections?">projected fantasy stats for Week 2</a> and grabbed the projected top scoring quarterback, running back, and wide receiver from each NFL team. These players were used to populate our player spreadsheets, one sheet for each of the five positions on a fantasy team. Finally, we randomly generated five numbers for each contest entry. Each number corresponds to a row in the one of the player spreadsheets, and the player in that row is on your team. </span>Unlike traditional fantasy football, players are not unique to a CodeBetter.Com fantasy team, but no two teams have the same five players&#8230; Got all that?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Scoring</h2>
<p>Your team score is the combined score of your five players. The team with the highest score wins. If there is a tie for highest score, the earliest entry will win. We will <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/leaders?&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2011">pull player scores from ESPN</a> - they use <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=fflrulesstandardscoring">the ESPN Standard Scoring System</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Offense</strong><br />
Quarterbacks (QB), Running Backs (RB), Wide Receivers (WR), Tight Ends (TE)<br />
6 pts per rushing or receiving TD<br />
6 pts for player returning kick/punt for TD<br />
6 pts for player returning or recovering a fumble for TD<br />
4 pts per passing TD<br />
2 pts per rushing or receiving 2 pt conversion  (note: teams do not receive points for yardage gained during the conversion)<br />
2 pts per passing 2 pt conversion<br />
1 pt  per 10 yards rushing or receiving<br />
1 pt  per 25 yards passing</div>
<div><strong>Bonus Points</strong><br />
2 pts per rushing or receiving TD of 40 yards or more<br />
2 pts per passing TD of 40 yards or more<br />
(note: the player must score a touchdown to score the points)</div>
<div><strong>Penalty Points</strong><br />
-2 pts per intercepted pass<br />
-2 pts per fumble lost</div>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Seems quite involved,&#8221; you protest. “I thought I didn’t have to do much to enter this contest.” Don&#8217;t worry, gentle reader, it <em>is</em> involved, but not for you.  Sit back, relax and enjoy the weekend.  We&#8217;re going to do all the work, sort out the team players over the next 24 hours, and post them on CodeBetter.Com by Sunday morning at 9AM EST.  Remember: The team with the highest score <strong>this week</strong> wins!  You can watch this weekend’s games, or follow online, and root for your fantasy team players.  We&#8217;ll post the winner by 5PM EST on Tuesday, September 20th.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Honorary CodeBetterer <a href="https://plus.google.com/112476111369212748300/posts">Ben Schoenfeld</a> (@oilytheotter) helped us figure all this out, and is the brains behind this scheme.  Hit him up on twitter if you have any questions or concerns, but he only takes complaints by mail written on $10 bills.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of March Madness, I&#8217;ve decided to choose the winner of the <a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/03/21/visual-studio-live-las-vegas-giveaway/">Visual Studio Live! Las Vegas contest</a> single-elimination bracket style.  There will be eight rounds, with a few unlucky entries* having to &#8220;play in&#8221; for the first round.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start the first round at 12:00 PM EST, with a new round results (decided by rolling a 20-sided dice of course) being announced on twitter @codebetter every 30 minutes.  The the final winner will be chosen at 3:30 and announced here.  You can follow along, and <a href="http://challonge.com/codebetter">see your place in the bracket at Challonge!</a></p>
<p>-Brendan</p>
<p>*I apologize for this, but as my friend said, &#8220;that&#8217;s how brackets work, son!&#8221;  Speaking of luck, I recently heard a tale of a hiring manager randomly crumpling up resumes of prospective new hires, and throwing them in the trash saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to work with unlucky people.&#8221;</p>

IN PRINT<br />
Jon Skeet<br />
November 2010 | 584 pages<br />
ISBN: 9781935182474</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">This article is taken from the book C# in Depth, Second Edition. The author explains optional parameters, whose values don’t have to be explicitly specified by the caller. He also talks about named arguments. The idea of named arguments is that, when you specify an argument value, you can also specify the name of the parameter it’s supplying the value for.</span></p>
<p>Optional parameters and named arguments are perhaps the Batman and Robin<sup><a href="#ftnt1">[1]</a></sup> features  of C# 4. They’re distinct but usually seen together. I’m going to keep  them apart for the moment so we can examine each in turn, but then we’ll  use them together for some more interesting examples.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #008000;">PARAMETERS AND ARGUMENTS</span> This  article obviously talks about parameters and arguments a lot. In casual  conversation, the two terms are often used interchangeably, but I’m  going to use them in line with their formal definitions. A parameter (also known as a formal parameter) is the variable that’s part of the method or indexer declaration. An argument is an expression used when calling the method or indexer. So, for example, consider this snippet:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">void Foo(int x, int y)
{
	// Do something with x and y
}
...
int a = 10;
Foo(a, 20);</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Here the parameters are x and y, and the arguments are a and 20.</p>
<p>We’ll start by looking at optional parameters.</p>
<h2>Optional parameters</h2>
<p>Visual  Basic has had optional parameters for ages, and they’ve been in the CLR  from .NET 1.0. The concept is as obvious as it sounds: some parameters  are optional, so their values don’t have to be explicitly specified by  the caller. Any parameter that hasn’t been specified as an argument by  the caller is given a default value.<span id="more-119"></span></p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Optional  parameters are usually used when there are several values required for  an operation, where the same values are used a lot of the time. For  example, suppose you wanted to read a text file; you might want to  provide a method that allows the caller to specify the name of the file  and the encoding to use. The encoding is almost always UTF-8, though, so  it’s nice to be able to use that automatically if it’s all you need.</p>
<p>Historically  the idiomatic way of allowing this in C# has been to use method  overloading: declare one method with all the possible parameters, and  others that call that method, passing in default values where  appropriate. For instance, you might create methods like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public IList&lt;Customer&gt; LoadCustomers(string filename,
							   Encoding encoding)
{
	...   #A
}

public IList&lt;Customer&gt; LoadCustomers(string filename)
{
	return LoadCustomers(filename, Encoding.UTF8);   #B
}

#A Do real work here
#B Default to UTF-8</pre>
<p>This  works fine for a single parameter, but it becomes trickier when there  are multiple options. Each extra option doubles the number of possible  overloads, and if two of them are of the same type, you can have  problems due to trying to declare multiple methods with the same  signature. Often the same set of overloads is also required for multiple  parameter types. For example, the <em>XmlReader.Create()</em> method can create an <em>XmlReader</em> from a <em>Stream</em>, a <em>TextReader,</em> or a <em>string</em>—but it also provides the option of specifying an <em>XmlReaderSettings</em> and  other arguments. Due to this duplication, there are 12 overloads for  the method. This could be significantly reduced with optional  parameters. Let’s see how it’s done.</p>
<h3>Declaring optional parameters and omitting them when supplying arguments</h3>
<p>Making  a parameter optional is as simple as supplying a default value for it,  using what looks like a variable initializer. Figure 1 shows a method  with three parameters: two are optional, one is required.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-140" title="fig1" src="http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig1.png" alt="" width="280" height="169" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Figure 1 Declaring optional parameters</span></p>
<p>All  the method does is print out the arguments, but that’s enough to see  what&#8217;s going on. The following listing gives the full code and calls the  method three times, specifying a different number of arguments for each  call.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Listing 1 Declaring a method with optional parameters and calling</span></p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static void Dump(int x, int y = 20, int z = 30)    #1
{
	Console.WriteLine("x={0} y={1} z={2}", x, y, z);
}
...
Dump(1, 2, 3);	#2
Dump(1, 2);	#3
Dump(1);    	#4
#1 Declares method with optional parameters
#2 Calls method with all arguments
#3 Omits one argument
#4 Omits two arguments</pre>
<p>The optional parameters are the ones with default values specified (#1). If the caller doesn’t specify y, its initial value will be 20, and likewise z has  a default value of 30. The first call (#2) explicitly specifies all the  arguments; the remaining calls (#2 and #4) omit one or two arguments  respectively, so the default values are used. When there’s one argument  missing, the compiler assumes that the final parameter has been  omitted—then the penultimate one, and so on. The output is therefore</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">x=1 y=2 z=3
x=1 y=2 z=30
x=1 y=20 z=30</pre>
<p>Note that although the compiler could use  some clever analysis of the types of the optional parameters and the  arguments to work out what’s been left out, it doesn’t: it assumes that  you’re supplying arguments in the same order as the parameters<sup><a href="#ftnt2">[2]</a></sup>. This means that the following code is invalid:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static void TwoOptionalParameters( int x = 10,
					 	string y = "default")
{
	Console.WriteLine("x={0} y={1}", x, y);
}
...
TwoOptionalParameters("second parameter");    #A
#A Error!</pre>
<p>This tries to call the TwoOptionalParameters method specifying a string for the first argument.  There’s no overload with a first parameter that’s convertible from a  string, so the compiler issues an error. This is a good thing—overload  resolution is tricky enough (particularly when generic type inference  gets involved) without the compiler trying all kinds of different  permutations to find something you might be trying to call.</p>
<p>If you want to omit the value for one optional parameter but specify a later one, you need to use named arguments.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on optional parameters</h3>
<p>There  are a few rules for optional parameters. All optional parameters must  come after required parameters. The exception to this is a parameter array (as declared with the params modifier),  which still has to come at the end of a parameter list, but can come  after optional parameters. A parameter array can’t be declared as an  optional parameter—if the caller doesn’t specify any values for it, an  empty array will be used instead. Optional parameters can’t have ref or out modifiers either.</p>
<p>An  optional parameter can be of any type, but there are restrictions on  the default value specified. You can always use constants: numeric and  string literals, null, const members, enum members, and the default(T) operator. Additionally, for value types, you can call the parameterless constructor, although this is equivalent to using the default (&#8230;) operator anyway. There has to be an implicit conversion from the specified value to the parameter type, but this must not be a user-defined conversion.</p>

<p>The  fact that the default value has to be constant is a pain in two  different ways. One of them is familiar from a slightly different  context, as we’ll see now.</p>
<h3>Versioning and optional parameters</h3>
<p>The restrictions on default values for optional parameters may remind you of the restrictions on const fields  or attribute values, and they behave very similarly. In both cases,  when the compiler references the value, it copies it directly into the  output. The generated IL acts exactly as if your original source code  had contained the default value. This means if you ever change the  default value without recompiling everything that references it, the  old callers will still be using the old default value. To make this  concrete, imagine this set of steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a class library (Library.dll) with a class like this:
<pre class="brush: csharp">public class LibraryDemo
{
	public static void PrintValue(int value = 10)
	{
		System.Console.WriteLine(value);
	}
}</pre>
</li>
<li>Create a console application (Application.exe) that references the class library:
<pre class="brush: csharp">public class Program
{
	static void Main()
	{
		LibraryDemo.PrintValue();
	}
}</pre>
</li>
<li>Run the application—it’ll print 10, predictably.</li>
<li>Change the declaration of PrintValue as follows, then recompile just the class library:
<pre class="brush: csharp">public static void PrintValue(int value = 20)</pre>
</li>
<li>Rerun the application—it’ll still print 10. The value has been compiled directly into the executable.</li>
<li>Recompile the application and rerun it—this time it’ll print 20.</li>
</ol>
<p>This versioning issue can cause bugs that are hard to track down, because all the code looks correct.  Essentially, you’re restricted to using genuine constants that should  never change as default values for optional parameters<sup><a href="#ftnt3">[3]</a></sup>. There’s  one benefit of this setup: it gives the caller a guarantee that the  value it knew about at compile-time is the one that’ll be used.  Developers may feel more comfortable with that than with a dynamically  computed value, or one that depends on the version of the library used  at execution time.</p>
<p>Of course,  this also means you can’t use any values that can’t be expressed as  constants anyway—you can’t create a method with a default value of “the  current time,” for example.</p>
<h3>Making defaults more flexible with nullity</h3>
<p>Fortunately,  there’s a way round this. Essentially you introduce a magic value to  represent the default, and then replace that magic value with the real default within the method itself. If the phrase magic value bothers you, I’m not surprised—except we’re going to use null for  the magic value, which already represents the absence of a normal  value. If the parameter type would normally be a value type, we simply  make it the corresponding nullable value type, at which point we can  still specify that the default value is null.</p>
<p>As  an example of this, let’s look at a similar situation to the one I used  to introduce the whole topic: allowing the caller to supply an  appropriate text encoding to a method, but defaulting to UTF-8. We can’t  specify the default encoding as Encoding. UTF8 as  that’s not a constant value, but we can treat a null parameter value as  “use the default.” To demonstrate how we can handle value types, we’ll  make the method append a timestamp to a text file with a message. We’ll  default the encoding to UTF-8 and the timestamp to the current time.  Listing 2 shows the complete code and a few examples of using it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Listing 2 Using null default values to handle nonconstant situations</span></p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static void AppendTimestamp(string filename,    #A
					string message,
					Encoding encoding = null,   #1
					DateTime? timestamp = null)

{
	Encoding realEncoding = encoding ?? Encoding.UTF8;   #2
	DateTime realTimestamp = timestamp ?? DateTime.Now;
	using (TextWriter writer = new StreamWriter(filename,
								     true,
								     realEncoding))
	{
		writer.WriteLine("{0:s}: {1}", realTimestamp, message);
	}
}

...

AppendTimestamp("utf8.txt", "First message");
AppendTimestamp("ascii.txt", "ASCII", Encoding.ASCII);
AppendTimestamp("utf8.txt", "Message in the future", null,   #3
			 new DateTime(2030, 1, 1));

#A Two required parameters
#1 Two optional parameters
#2 Null coalescing operator for convenience
#3 Explicit use of null</pre>
<p>Listing  2 shows a few nice features of this approach. First, we’ve solved the  versioning problem. The default values for the optional parameters are  null (#1), but the effective values  are “the UTF-8 encoding” and “the current date and time.” Neither of  these could be expressed as constants, and should we ever wish to change  the effective default—for example to use the current UTC time instead  of the local time—we could do so without having to recompile everything  that called AppendTimestamp.  Of course, changing the effective default changes the behavior of the  method—you need to take the same sort of care over this as you would  with any other code change. At this point, you (as the library author)  are in charge of the versioning story—you’re taking responsibility for  not breaking clients, effectively. At least it’s more familiar  territory: you know that all callers will experience the same behavior,  regardless of recompilation.</p>
<p>We’ve  also introduced an extra level of flexibility. Not only do optional  parameters mean we can make the calls shorter, but having a specific  “use the default” value means that should we ever wish to, we can explicitly make  a call allowing the method to choose the appropriate value. At the  moment, this is the only way we know to specify the timestamp explicitly  without also providing an encoding (#3), but that’ll change when we  look at named arguments.</p>
<p>The  optional parameter values are simple to deal with thanks to the null  coalescing operator (#2). I’ve used separate variables for the sake of  printed formatting, but in real code you’d probably use the same  expressions directly in the calls to the Stream-Writer constructor and the WriteLine method.</p>
<p>There are two downsides to this approach: first, it means that if a caller accidentally passes in null due  to a bug, it’ll get the default value instead of an exception. In cases  where you’re using a nullable value type and callers will either  explicitly use null or have a non-nullable argument, that’s not much of a  problem—but for reference types it could be an issue.</p>
<p>On a related note, it requires that you don’t want to use null as a “real” value<sup><a href="#ftnt4">[4]</a></sup>. There are occasions where you want null to mean null—and  if you don’t want that to be the default value, you’ll have to find a  different constant or just leave the parameter as a required one. But in  other cases where there isn’t an obvious constant value that’ll clearly  always be the right  default, I’d recommend this approach to optional parameters as one  that’s easy to follow consistently and removes some of the normal  difficulties.</p>
<p>We’ll need to  look at how optional parameters affect overload resolution, but it makes  sense to wait until we’ve seen how named arguments work. Speaking of  which&#8230;</p>
<h2>Named arguments</h2>
<p>The  basic idea of named arguments is that when you specify an argument  value, you can also specify the name of the parameter it’s supplying the  value for. The compiler then makes sure that there is a  parameter of the right name, and uses the value for that parameter.  Even on its own, this can increase readability in some cases. In  reality, named arguments are most useful in cases where optional  parameters are also likely to appear, but we’ll look at the simple  situation first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #008000;">INDEXERS, OPTIONAL PARAMETERS, AND NAMED ARGUMENTS</span> You can use  optional parameters and named arguments with indexers as well as  methods. But this is only useful for indexers with more than one  parameter: you can’t access an indexer without specifying at least one  argument anyway. Given this limitation, I don’t expect to see the  feature used much with indexers. It works exactly as you’d expect it to,  though.</p>
<p>I’m sure we’ve all seen code that looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">MessageBox.Show("Please do not press this button again", // text
			 "Ouch!"); // title</pre>
<p>I’ve  actually chosen a pretty tame example; it can get a lot worse when  there are loads of arguments, especially if a lot of them are the same  type. But this is still realistic: even with just two parameters, I’d  find myself guessing which argument meant what based on the text when  reading this code, unless it had comments like the ones I have here.  There’s a problem though: comments can lie about the code they describe.  Nothing is checking them at all. Named arguments ask the compiler to  help.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>All we need to do to the previous example is prefix each argument with the name of the corresponding parameter and a colon:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">MessageBox.Show(text: "Please do not press this button again",
			 caption: "Ouch!");</pre>
<p>Admittedly we now don’t get to choose the name we find most meaningful (I prefer title to caption)  but at least we’ll know if we get something wrong. Of course, the most  common way in which we could get something wrong here is to get the  arguments the wrong way around. Without named arguments, this would be a  problem: we’d end up with the pieces of text switched in the message  box. With named arguments, the ordering becomes largely irrelevant. We  can rewrite the previous code like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">MessageBox.Show(caption: "Ouch!",
			 text: "Please do not press this button again");</pre>
<p>We’d  still have the right text in the right place, because the compiler  would work out what we meant based on the names. For another example,  look at the StreamWriter constructor call we used in listing 2. The second argument is just true—what  does this mean? Is it going to force a stream flush after every write?  Include a byte order mark? Append to an existing file instead of  creating a new one? Here’s the equivalent call using named arguments:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">new StreamWriter(path: filename,
			 append: true,
			 encoding: realEncoding)</pre>
<p>In both of the examples, we’ve seen how named arguments effectively attach semantic meaning to  values. In the never-ending quest to make our code communicate better  with humans as well as computers, this is a definite step forward. I’m  not suggesting that named arguments should be used when the meaning is  already obvious, of course. Like all features, it should be used with  discretion and thought.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #008000;">NAMED ARGUMENTS WITH</span> <strong>out </strong><span style="color: #008000;">AND </span><strong>ref </strong>If you want to specify the name of an argument for a ref or out parameter, you put the ref or out modifier after the name, and before the argument. So using int.TryParse as an example, you might have code like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">int number;
bool success = int.TryParse("10", result: out number);</pre>
<p>To  explore some other aspects of the syntax, the following listing shows a  method with three integer parameters, just like the one we used to  start looking at optional parameters.</p>
<p>Listing 3 Simple examples of using named arguments</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static void Dump(int x, int y, int z)   #1
{
	Console.WriteLine("x={0} y={1} z={2}", x, y, z);
}
...
Dump(1, 2, 3);   		#2
Dump(x: 1, y: 2, z: 3);	#3
Dump(z: 3, y: 2, x: 1);
Dump(1, y: 2, z: 3);    	#4
Dump(1, z: 3, y: 2);

#1 Declares method as normal
#2 Calls method as normal
#3 Specifies names for all arguments
#4 Specifies names for some arguments</pre>
<p>The output is the same for each call in listing 3: x=1, y=2, z=3.  We’ve effectively made the same method call in five different ways.  It’s worth noting that there are no tricks in the method declaration  (#1): you can use named arguments with any method that has parameters.  First we call the method in the normal way, without using any new  features (#2). This is a sort of control point to make sure that the  other calls really are equivalent. We then make two calls to the method  using just named arguments (#3). The second of these calls reverses the  order of the arguments, but the result is still the same, because the  arguments are matched up with the parameters by name, not position.  Finally there are two calls using a mixture of named arguments and positional arguments (#4).  A positional argument is one that isn’t named—so every argument in  valid C# 3 code is a positional argument from the point of view of C# 4.  Figure 2 shows how the final line of code works.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141" title="fig2" src="http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig2.png" alt="" width="304" height="158" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Figure 2 Positional and named arguments in the same call</span></p>
<p>All named arguments have to come after positional arguments—you can’t switch between the styles. Positional arguments always refer  to the corresponding parameter in the method declaration—you can’t make  positional arguments skip a parameter by specifying it later with a  named argument. This means that these method calls would both be  invalid:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dump(z: 3, 1, y: 2)—Positional arguments must come before named ones.</li>
<li>Dump(2, x: 1, z: 3)—x has already been specified by the first positional argument, so we can’t specify it again with a named argument.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, although in this particular case the method calls have been equivalent, that’s not always the case. Let’s look at why reordering arguments might change behavior.</p>
<h3>Argument evaluation order</h3>
<p>We’re  used to C# evaluating its arguments in the order they’re  specified—which, until C# 4, has always been the order in which the  parameters have been declared too. In C# 4, only the first part is still  true: the arguments are still evaluated in the order they’re written,  even if that’s not the same as the order in which they’re declared as  parameters. This matters if evaluating the arguments has side effects.  It’s usually worth  trying to avoid having side effects in arguments, but there are cases  where it can make the code clearer. A more realistic rule is to try to  avoid side effects that might interfere with each other. For the sake of  demonstrating execution order, we’ll break both of these rules. Please  don’t treat this as a recommendation that you do the same thing.</p>
<p>First  we’ll create a relatively harmless example, introducing a method that  logs its input and returns it—a sort of logging echo. We’ll use the  return values of three calls to this to call the Dump method (which isn’t shown, as it hasn’t changed). Listing 4 shows two calls to Dump that result in slightly different output.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Listing 4 Logging argument evaluation</span></p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static int Log(int value)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Log: {0}", value);
	return value;
}
...
Dump(x: Log(1), y: Log(2), z: Log(3));
Dump(z: Log(3), x: Log(1), y: Log(2));</pre>
<p>The results of running listing 4 show what happens:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">Log: 1
Log: 2
Log: 3
x=1 y=2 z=3
Log: 3
Log: 1
Log: 2
x=1 y=2 z=3</pre>
<p>In both cases, the parameters in the Dump method  are still 1, 2, and 3, in that order. But we can see that although they  were evaluated in that order in the first call (which was equivalent to  just using positional arguments), the second call evaluated the value  used for the z parameter  first. We can make the effect even more significant by using side  effects that change the results of the argument evaluation, as shown in  the following listing, again using the same Dump method.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Listing 5 Abusing argument evaluation order</span></p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">int i = 0;
Dump(x: ++i, y: ++i, z: ++i);
i = 0;
Dump(z: ++i, x: ++i, y: ++i);</pre>
<p>The  results of listing 5 may be best expressed in terms of the blood  spatter pattern at a murder scene, after someone maintaining code like  this has gone after the original author with an axe. Yes, technically speaking the last line prints out x=2 y=3 z=1 but  I’m sure you see what I’m getting at. Just say “no” to code like this.  By all means, reorder your arguments for the sake of readability: you  may think that laying out a call to MessageBox.Show with  the title coming above the text in the code itself reflects the  onscreen layout more closely, for example. If you want to rely on a  particular evaluation order for the arguments, though, introduce some  local variables to execute the relevant code in separate statements. The  compiler won’t care either way—it’ll follow the rules of the spec—but  this reduces the risk of a “harmless refactoring” that inadvertently  introduces a subtle bug.</p>
<p>To  return to cheerier matters, let’s combine the two features (optional  parameters and named arguments) and see how much tidier the code can be.</p>
<h2>Putting the two together</h2>
<p>The  two features work in tandem with no extra effort required on your part.  It’s not uncommon to have a bunch of parameters where there are obvious  defaults, but where it’s hard to predict which ones a caller will want  to specify explicitly. Figure 3 shows just about every combination: a  required parameter, two optional parameters, a positional argument, a  named argument, and a missing argument for an optional parameter.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142" title="fig3" src="http://cdn1.codebetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig3.png" alt="" width="351" height="166" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Figure 3 Mixing named arguments and optional parameters</span></p>
<p>Going  back to an earlier example, in listing 2 we wanted to append a  timestamp to a file using the default encoding of UTF-8, but with a  particular timestamp. Back then we just used null for the encoding argument, but now we can write the same code more simply, as shown in the following listing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Listing 6 Combining named and optional arguments</span></p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static void AppendTimestamp(string filename,
					string message,
					Encoding encoding = null,
					DateTime? timestamp = null)
{
	#A
}

...

AppendTimestamp("utf8.txt", "Message in the future",	#B
timestamp: new DateTime(2030, 1, 1));      		#C
#A Same implementation as before
#B Encoding is omitted
#C Named timestamp argument</pre>
<p>In  this fairly simple situation, the benefit isn’t particularly huge, but  in cases where you want to omit three or four arguments but specify the  final one, it’s a real blessing.</p>
<p>We’ve  seen how optional parameters reduce the need for huge long lists of  overloads, but one specific pattern where this is worth mentioning is  with respect to immutability.</p>
<h3>Immutability and object initialization</h3>
<p>One aspect of C# 4 that disappoints me somewhat is that it hasn’t done much explicitly to  make immutability easier. Immutable types are a core part of functional  programming, and C# has been gradually supporting the functional style  more and more&#8230; except for immutability. Object and collection  initializers make it easy to work with mutable types,  but immutable types have been left out in the cold. (Automatically  implemented properties fall into this category too.) Fortunately, though  they’re not particularly designed to aid immutability, named arguments  and optional parameters allow you to write object initializer–like code  that just calls a constructor or other factory method. For instance,  suppose we were creating a Message class, which required a from address, a to address, and a body,  with the subject and attachment being optional. (We’ll stick with  single recipients in order to keep the example as simple as possible.)  We could create a mutable type with appropriate writable properties, and construct instances like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">Message message = new Message {
	From = "skeet@pobox.com",
	To = "csharp-in-depth-readers@everywhere.com",
	Body = "Hope you like the second edition",
	Subject = "A quick message"
};</pre>
<p>That  has two problems: first, it doesn’t enforce the required data to be  provided. We could force those to be supplied to the constructor, but  then (before C# 4) it wouldn’t be obvious which argument meant what:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">Message message = new Message(
	"skeet@pobox.com",
	"csharp-in-depth-readers@everywhere.com",
	"Hope you like the second edition")
{
	Subject = "A quick message"
};</pre>
<p>The  second problem is that this initialization pattern simply doesn’t work  for immutable types. The compiler has to call a property setter after it  has initialized the object. But we can use optional parameters and  named arguments to come up with something that has the nice features of  the first form (only specifying what you’re interested in and supplying  names) without losing the validation of which aspects of the message are  required or the benefits of immutability. The following listing shows a  possible constructor signature and the construction step for the same  message as before.</p>
<p>Listing 7 Constructing an immutable message using C# 4</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public Message(string from, string to,
	string body, string subject = null,
	byte[] attachment = null)
{
	#A
}

#A Normal initialization code goes here</pre>
<p>I  really like this in terms of readability and general cleanliness. You  don’t need hundreds of constructor overloads to choose from, just one  with some of the parameters being optional. The same syntax will also  work with static creation methods, unlike object initializers. The only  downside is that it really relies on your code being consumed by a  language that supports optional parameters and named arguments;  otherwise callers will be forced to write ugly code to specify values  for all the optional parameters. Obviously there’s more to immutability  than getting values to the initialization code, but this is a welcome  step in the right direction nonetheless.</p>
<p>There  are a couple of final points to make around these features before we  move on to COM, both around the details of how the compiler handles our  code and the difficulty of good API design.</p>
<h3>Overload resolution</h3>
<p>Clearly  both named arguments and optional parameters affect how the compiler  resolves overloads—if there are multiple method signatures available  with the same name, which should it pick? Optional parameters can increase the  number of applicable methods (if some methods have more parameters than  the number of specified arguments) and named arguments can decrease the number of applicable methods (by ruling out methods that don’t have the appropriate parameter names).</p>
<p>For  the most part, the changes are intuitive: to check whether any  particular method is applicable, the compiler tries to build a list of  the arguments it would pass  in, using the positional arguments in order, then matching the named  arguments up with the remaining parameters. If a required parameter  hasn’t been specified or if a named argument doesn’t match any remaining  parameters, the method isn’t applicable.</p>
<p>There  are two situations I’d like to draw particular attention to. First, if  two methods are both applicable and one of them has been given all of  its arguments explicitly whereas the other uses an optional parameter  filled in with a default value, the method that doesn’t use any default  values will win. But this doesn’t extend  to just comparing the number of default values used—it’s a strict “does  it use default values or not” divide. For example, consider the  following:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">static void Foo(int x = 10) {}
static void Foo(int x = 10, int y = 20) {}
...
Foo(); 	#1
Foo(1);     	#2
Foo(y: 2);  #3
Foo(1, 2);  #4

#1 Error: ambiguous
#2 Calls first overload
#3 Calls second overload
#4 Calls second overload</pre>
<p>In  the first call (#1), both methods are applicable because of their  optional parameters. But the compiler can’t work out which one you meant  to call: it’ll raise an error. In the second call (#2), both methods  are still applicable, but the first overload is used because it can be  applied without using any default values, whereas the second overload  uses the default value for y. For both the third and fourth calls, only the second overload is applicable. The third call (#3) names the y argument, and the fourth call (#4) has two arguments; both of these mean the first overload isn’t applicable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #008000;">OVERLOADS AND INHERITANCE DON’T ALWAYS MIX NICELY</span> All  of this is assuming that the compiler has gone as far as finding  multiple overloads to choose between. If some methods are declared in a  base type, but there are applicable methods in a more derived type, the  latter will win. This has always been the case, and it can cause some  surprising results (see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmng.bz%2FaEmE%29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUjHMqezNuKAgk5qhzCVvozNpbtw">http://mng.bz/aEmE)</a>&#8230;  but now optional parameters mean there may be more applicable methods  than you’d expect. I advise you to avoid overloading a base class method  within a derived class unless you get a huge benefit.</p>
<p>The  second point is that sometimes named arguments can be an alternative to  casting in order to help the compiler resolve overloads. Sometimes a  call can be ambiguous because the arguments can be converted to the  parameter types in two different methods, but neither method is better  than the other in all respects. For instance, consider the following  method signatures and a call:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">void Method(int x, object y) { ... }
void Method(object a, int b) { ... }
...
Method(10, 10);	#A
#A Ambiguous call</pre>
<p>Both  methods are applicable, and neither is better than the other. There are  two ways to resolve this, assuming you can’t change the method names to  make them unambiguous that way. (That’s my preferred approach. Make  each method name more informative and specific, and the general  readability of the code can go up.) You can either cast one of the  arguments explicitly, or use named arguments to resolve the ambiguity:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">void Method(int x, object y) { ... }
void Method(object a, int b) { ... }
...
Method(10, (object) 10);   #A
Method(x: 10, y: 10);   #B
#A Casting to resolve ambiguity
#B Naming to resolve ambiguity</pre>
<p>Of  course this only works if the parameters have different names in the  different methods—but it’s a handy trick to know. Sometimes the cast  will give more readable code; sometimes the name will. It’s just an  extra weapon in the fight for clear code. It does have a downside, along  with named arguments in general: it’s another thing to be careful about  when you change a method.</p>
<h3>The silent horror of changing names</h3>
<p>In  the past, parameter names haven’t mattered much if you’ve only been  using C#. Other languages may have cared, but in C# the only times that  parameter names were important were when you were looking at  IntelliSense and when you were looking at the method code itself. Now,  the parameter names of a method are effectively part of the API even if  you’re only using C#. If you change them at a later date, code can  break—anything that was using a named argument to refer to one of your  parameters will fail to compile if you decide to change it. This may not  be much of an issue if your code is only consumed by itself anyway, but  if you’re writing a public API, be aware that changing a parameter name  is a big deal. It always has been really, but if everything calling the  code was written in C#, we’ve been able to ignore that until now.</p>
<p>Renaming  parameters is bad; switching the names around is worse. That way the  calling code may still compile, but with a different meaning. A  particularly evil form of this is to override a method and switch the  parameter names in the overridden version. The compiler will always look  at the deepest override it knows about, based on the static type of the  expression used as the target of the method call. You don’t want to get  into a situation where calling the same method implementation with the  same argument list results in different behavior based on the static  type of a variable.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Named  arguments and optional parameters are possibly two of the  simplest-sounding features of C# 4—and yet they still have a fair amount  of complexity, as we’ve seen. The basic ideas are easily expressed and  understood—and the good news is that most of the time that’s all you  need to care about. You can take advantage of optional parameters to  reduce the number of overloads you write, and named arguments can make  code much more readable when several easily confusable arguments are  used. The trickiest bit is probably deciding which default values to  use, bearing in mind potential versioning issues. Likewise it’s now more  obvious than before that parameter names matter, and you need to be  careful when overriding existing methods, to avoid being evil to your  callers.</p>

<p><a name="ftnt4">[4]</a> We almost need a second null-like special value, meaning “please use  the default value for this parameter”—and allow that special value to be  supplied either automatically for missing arguments or explicitly in  the argument list. I’m sure this would cause dozens of problems, but  it’s an interesting thought experiment.</p>
