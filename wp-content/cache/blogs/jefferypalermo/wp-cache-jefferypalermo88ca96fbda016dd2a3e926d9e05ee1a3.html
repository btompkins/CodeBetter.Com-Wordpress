<p>PSD2HTML has several examples showing how a design is converted into XHtml and CSS.&nbsp; You can examine all the code on <a href="http://psd2html.com/examples.html">their examples page</a>.&nbsp; It&#8217;s interesting to see the techniques used by a company whose core competency is XHtml and CSS.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/hex/">Eric Hexter</a> and I&nbsp;started the MvcContrib project, we&#8217;ve mandated a&nbsp;high test coverage.&nbsp; If a patch comes without tests, we&#8217;d reject the patch.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Given that MvcContrib exists for the purpose of supplementing a presentation library, ASP.NET MVC, you might think it&#8217;s not possible to achieve such a high percentage.</p>
<p>If you were ever curious about how this is done, I invite you to take a look at the project.&nbsp; The project has 1058 tests at this point and the main MvcContrib.dll assembly has 99% test coverage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, when code is test-driven, the test coverage naturally falls out of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>By the way, Eric just released </strong><strong><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14617">version 0.0.1.118 of MvcContrib</a> to CodePlex.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep tabs on MvcContrib by following my feed:&nbsp; <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeffreypalermo">http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeffreypalermo</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m amazed that there is so much talk about object/relational mappers these days.&nbsp; Pleased, but amazed.&nbsp; I tend to be in the &#8220;early adopter&#8221; part of the Rogers technology adoption curve. (Subscribe to my feed:&nbsp; <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeffreypalermo">http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeffreypalermo</a>)</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/DiffusionOfInnovation.png"> </p>
<p>In the .Net world, I didn&#8217;t hear much talk about O/R Mappers in the early 2000s.&nbsp; I started working with NHibernate in 2005 while on a project with <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/">Jeremy Miller</a>, <a href="http://donie.homeip.net:8080/pebble/Steve/">Steve Donie</a>, <a href="http://jimhmatthews.wordpress.com/">Jim Matthews</a>, and <a href="http://www.pettichord.com/">Bret Pettichord</a>.&nbsp; I researched, but never used, other O/R Mappers available at the time.&nbsp; Now, in 2008, I find that O/R Mappers in the .Net world are still in the early adopter part of the adoption curve.&nbsp; We have not yet hit early majority, but we have left the innovators section.</p>
<p>Microsoft has single-handedly pushed O/R Mapping to the center of conversation, and we struggle to objectively differentiate between the choices.&nbsp; Arguments like &#8220;Tool X rocks&#8221;, or &#8220;Tool Y sucks&#8221; are hard to understand.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to more objectively discuss the basis on which we should accept or reject an O/R Mapper.&nbsp; As always, it depends on context.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Context 1</b>:&nbsp; Small,&nbsp;disposable&nbsp;application:&nbsp; In this case, we would put a premium on time to market while accepting technical debt given the application has a known lifespan.&nbsp; For this type of of situation, I think it depends on the skill set of the team we start with.&nbsp; If the team already knows an O/R Mapper, the team should probably stick with it since the learning curve of any other tool would slow down delivery.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Context 2</b>:&nbsp; Complex line-of-business application:&nbsp; Here, the business is making an investment by building a system that is expected to yield return on the engineering investment.&nbsp; The life of the application is unbounded, so maintainability is king.&nbsp; We still want to be able to build quickly, but long-term cost of ownership has a heavy hand in decisions.&nbsp; Here, we have to objectively think about the tools used by the system.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2603379998_d064027cbd_o.png" align="right"> I&#8217;ll use O/R Mappers in this example.&nbsp; On the right is a common visual studio solution structure.&nbsp; We would probably leverage the O/R Mapper in the DataAccess project.&nbsp; I consider the O/R Mapper to be infrastructure since it doesn&#8217;t add business value to the application.&nbsp; It merely is plumbing to help the application function.&nbsp; By following the references, we find that our business logic is coupled to the data access approach we choose as well as infrastructure we employ.&nbsp; Often we can build the system like this, and we can even keep the defect rate really low.&nbsp; This is very common, and I&#8217;d venture to guess that most readers have some experience with this type of structure.&nbsp; The problem with this structure is long-term maintainability.&nbsp; In keeping with the O/R Mapper decision, five years ago, I was not using NHibernate.&nbsp; If I ask myself if I&#8217;ll be using NHibernate five years from now, I have to assume that I probably won&#8217;t be, given the pace of technology.&nbsp; If this system has a chance of maintainability five years from now, I need to be able to upgrade parts of the system that are most affected by the pace of technology, like data access.&nbsp; My business logic shouldn&#8217;t be held hostage by the data access decision I made back in 2008.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a justified business position to say that when technology moves on, we will rewrite entire systems to keep up.&nbsp; Sadly, most of the industry operates this way.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/2603380030_d57dcd1c6a_o.png" align="left"> </p>
<p>On the left is the general solution structure I&#8217;m more in favor of.&nbsp; You see that the core of the application doesn&#8217;t reference my other projects.&nbsp; The core project (give it whatever name you like) contains all my business logic, namely the domain model and supporting logical services that give my application its unique behaviors.&nbsp; Add a presentation layer for some screens, and the system delivers business value.&nbsp; Here, you see I&#8217;ve lumped data access in with infrastructure.&nbsp; <b>Data access is just not that interesting, </b>and system users don&#8217;t give a hoot how we write to the database.&nbsp; As long as the system is usable and has good response times, they are happy.&nbsp; After all, they are most happy when they are _not_ using the system.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t spend their leisure time using our system.</p>
<p>I consider data access to be infrastructure because it changes every year or two.&nbsp; Also consider communication protocols like ASMX, remoting, WCF to be infrastructure.&nbsp; WCF, too, will pass in a year or 10 for the next wave of communication protocols that &#8220;will solve all our business problems&#8221;.&nbsp; Given this reality, it&#8217;s best not to couple the application to infrastructure.&nbsp; Any application today that is coupled to Enterprise Library data access will likely have to be completely rewritten in order to take advantage of any newer data access method.&nbsp; I&#8217;d venture to say that the management that approved the budget for the creation of said system didn&#8217;t know that a rewrite would be eminent in just 4 short years.</p>
<p><b>How do we ensure the long-term maintainability of our systems in the face of constantly changing infrastructure?</b>&nbsp; The answer:&nbsp; Don&#8217;t couple to infrastructure.&nbsp; Regardless of the O/R Mapping tool you choose, don&#8217;t couple to it.&nbsp; The core of your application should not know or care what data access library you are using.&nbsp; I am a big fan of NHibernate right now, but I still keep it at arms length and banished to forever live in the Infrastructure project in the solution.&nbsp; I know that when I want to dump NHibernate for the next thing, it won&#8217;t be a big deal</p>
<p><b>How do I ensure I&#8217;m not coupled to my O/R Mapper?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project my domain object reside in doesn&#8217;t have a reference to NHibernate.dll or your O/R Mapper of choice</li>
<li>The unit tests for my domain model don&#8217;t care about data access</li>
<li>My domain objects don&#8217;t have specific infrastructure code specific to the O/R Mapper</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is in the flipped project reference.&nbsp; Have the infrastructure project reference the core, not the other way around.&nbsp; My core project has no reference to NHibernate.dll.&nbsp; The UI project has not reference either.&nbsp; Only in the infrastructure project.</p>
<p><b>Keep it easy to dump NHibernate when its time has come</b></p>
<p>For now, NHibernate is the O/RM of choice in .Net-land.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it&#8217;s time comes, don&#8217;t go to management and recommend a rewrite of the system because it&#8217;s completely tightly-coupled to NHibernate.&nbsp; Keep NHibernate off to the side so you can slide in the next data access library that comes along.&nbsp; If you tightly couple to your O/RM, you&#8217;ll sacrifice long-term maintainability.</p>
<p><b>When choosing an O/R Mapper:</b>&nbsp; The objective criteria I think is most compelling is to determine of the library allows isolation.&nbsp; If the tool forces you to create an application around it, move on for a better one.&nbsp; The good libraries stay out of the way.&nbsp; If your O/R M always wants to be the center of attention, dump it for one that&#8217;s more humble.&nbsp; Use an O/R M that plays well behind a wall of interfaces.&nbsp; Beware the O/R M that doesn&#8217;t allow loose coupling.&nbsp; If you tightly couple, it&#8217;s a guaranteed rewrite when you decide to change data access strategies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Austin .Net User Group conducted its third annual Austin Code Camp on May 17, 2008.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/hex/">Eric Hexter</a> and <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/johnteague/">John Teague</a> did a great job heading up the effort to put on this weekend conference.&nbsp; Attendance was around 203, and St. Edward&#8217;s PEC graciously hosted again.&nbsp; Those facilities are great!!</p>
<p>I was returning from the <a href="http://www.devteach.com">DevTeach</a> conference in Toronto, so I had to miss.&nbsp; Very unfortunate.&nbsp; I was able to vicariously experience it through reading second-hand reports from some of the attendees.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pseale.com/blog/">Peter Seale</a> provided some encouragement that the focus of the Austin .Net User Group is on the right track with <a href="http://www.pseale.com/blog/AustinCodeCamp2008Inspired.aspx">his report of the code camp</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The code camp <strong>did not feature </strong>an &#8220;Introduction to Silverlight&#8221; session. This is the simple, effective test by which I will measure all future conferences: <strong>is there an intro to Silverlight session</strong>. If there is, then good chances are most of the sessions will be useless. Further down the road, change out &#8220;Silverlight&#8221; with whatever new UI framework/data grid/designer tool that is &#8220;up to two years away from release.&#8221; I&#8217;m officially tired of these type of talks, <strong>4 LIFE</strong>. Call me back when you&#8217;re running a &#8220;Best Practices in Silverlight Smackdown.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>The code camp was heavy on OO principles. This is a good thing; between &#8220;patterns cage match&#8221; and &#8220;IoC jumpstart&#8221; and &#8220;OO design&#8221; and &#8220;mocks and stubs&#8221;, my brain was assaulted by lots of OO. Which is good, I haven&#8217;t gotten this much in the 3+ years of involvement with Houston user groups and events. Not to gripe on my home city, let&#8217;s stay positive etc.&#8221;</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently tried out Windows Server 2008 x64, and I&#8217;m gradually transitioning.&nbsp; I&#8217;m installing all the tools I have on my XP drive, but I won&#8217;t complete the switch until I&#8217;ve verified there are no blocking issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I regularly use Cropper to grab snapshots of my screens and portions of them.&nbsp; I tried running it, and it failed spectacularly!&nbsp; I decided to grab the code from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/cropper/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx">CodePlex</a> and see why it was failing. I ran through and was able to fix the issues.&nbsp; The main issue was that it was built against .Net 2.0 with Any CPU, but it depends on Win32 APIs.&nbsp; I switched the build configurations to x86, refactored an assembly load problem buried in a static constructor, modified the MSI setup project, and it started working.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve submitted a patch back to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/cropper">CodePlex project</a>, so if you need Cropper on x64 Vista or Server08, you can grab the code with TortoiseSVN, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/cropper/SourceControl/PatchList.aspx">apply the patch </a>and make your own build.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve sent Brian a note, so I&#8217;m hoping he&#8217;ll either add me to the project or apply the patch soon.</p>
<p>I used SvnBridge to pull down the source code.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to install Team Explorer JUST to pull down one project.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to report that SvnBridge 2.0 worked very well.&nbsp; I followed the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Using%20TortoiseSVN%20with%20CodePlex&amp;referringTitle=Source%20control%20clients">instructions here </a>for pulling down the source code with TortoiseSVN.&nbsp;</p>
